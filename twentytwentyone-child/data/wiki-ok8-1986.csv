She becomes his assistant and participates in the execution of his revolutionary theories. When the pair is about to make a great discovery, the professor disappears. The young woman is left behind with three unusual lodgers. Link, who takes care of the house. Imp, a computer science genius and Vadou, who is locked up because of his aggressive behaviour. Three monkeys that were subjected to the professors experiments. Because of his disappearance the student will have to use all of her energy to stand up to the laws of the jungle, control… the laws of animal instinct. 
Director Richard Franklin left the directing for Psycho 11 to Anthony Perkins. Franklin is a director who apparently wants to explore new fields in fantastic film. After Psycho 11 and Patrick he hasn’t made it easy for himself. Link is an anthropological thriller that does not only excel in originality of screenplay but also in the nature of the protagonists.

But sleeping could be destructive, because the dreams of this lovely young lady are far from innocent.

In reality Dreamlover is about Kristy McNichol’s therapy to detach herself from her compulsive illusions.
In Dreamlover Alan J. Pakula (All the President's Men, The Parralax View) has completely devoted himself to the sharp nature of the characters. No intestines splashing around or horrid demons, but an authentic psychological film"

All the sizes, limps and curves from their dreams are combined into one single model who steps out of the computer. Kelly Le Brock, a gorgeous piece of female beauty who is here to nurture their sensual education.
John Hughes (The Breakfast Club) directed one big adolescent wink to the myth of the (female) monster of Frankenstein. Weird Science is a compelling comic illustration of the new trend in the fantastic film. It combines the appetizing laughter with the ominous special effects (implemented by Graig Reardon from Poltergeist, ET and Henry Miller who showed what he was capable of in 2010). Add the irresistible looks of Kelly Le Brock (The Woman in Red) to all of this and you have a film you can’t miss, under any circumstances."

With his first film ‘Evil Dead’ Sam Raimi (then 23) was immediately considered a Grandmaster of gruesome. Ever since he wants to prove at all costs that he is capable of more than portraying a bloody slaughter. Sam Raimi recruited the Coen brothers (authors of the terrific Blood Simple) and committed an anarchic assault to the comic film world with ‘Crimewave’.

A script that can charm any moviestar was the outset for two young directors to gather an impressive cast: John Hurt (The Elephant Man, 1984, The Hit) who signed on first, Julian Sands (The Doctor and The Devils) who followed almost immediately after and Victoria Abril (La Lune dans le Caniveau) who supplied the production with an international tinge."

The pictures are surprisingly realistic and for a moment it seems as if her spirit, her voice and her body are physically present in the room.

Frank Holt realises that his reputation, bust most of all his confidence is at stake en starts an investigating the situation. He wants to get his hands on the medical file of his last patient at all costs, but something or someone is persistently trying to keep him from reading it.
This fascinating science fiction film is extraordinarily believable. Lead actor Joe Spano makes a stunning film debut as Frank Holt and is surrounded by Diane Venora (Wolfen, Manhatten), David McCallum (The Man From U.N.C.L.E) and the promising Robert Joy (Ticket to Heaven)."

His prestigious project consists of bringing two human organisms together in one single biological structure but he needs professor Dowell to bring it to a successful conclusion. The scientist in question is an old hand in the business who has devoted a lot of years of his life to the study of compatibility of certain organic tissues. But the professor kicks the bucket after a fatal car accident.
Not the least of Korns problems. The somewhat unusual surgeon with very few scruples digs up his old colleague, efficiently removes the head of the deceased and reactivates the brain. Dowell will have plenty of time to ask himself about the moral values and about the benefaction of science for that same science."

An insignificant original fact. It only becomes mysterious when Eileen is tormented with hallucinations in which she is silently and hostile approached by a gang of Teddy Boys who seem to want to hurt her…
Nomads turned out to be a ticking bomb on the preceding film market. When it finally exploded, the name of the director, John Mc Tierman was all everyone could talk about. Nomads is an authors film in the most literal sense of the word, it is about the promising debut of a director who could become the John Carpenter of the eighties. He strips his film from every reference to an existing reality and creates a surreal atmosphere that turns Nomads into a real spine chiller."

An eccentric man mixes all sorts of potions and handles strange objects. The health of the count of Ruk is steadily deteriorating and, to turn the tide, the court alchemist is fathoming the secret of the philosopher’s stone. On an ominous night he recites the formulas of a mysterious invocation. Is his invocation the cause of a series of mysterious incidents in the castle? That same night the dragon appeared for the first time. A roaring and fire-spitting monster covered in shiny scales.
In this super production, an original interpretation of one of the oldest written legends, Sword and Sorcery and Science Fiction are mixed together. We see Klaus Kinski in the role of the mysterious alchemist, Harvey Keitel as the glorious knight and Fernando Rey as the monk."

Only an animal-like group of cave woman, who have limited the interaction with the male gender to the use of their spermatozoa, have survived the catastrophe. What’s worse is that they hold the male gender responsible for this world tragedy that has destroyed humanity.
This is a science-fiction comedy with a political and philosophic touch that was registered by the 30-year-old Juliusz Machulski. This young Polish director who earned his stripes as an actor, screenwriter and cinematographer for television, obtained the grand price at the Festival of the Humoristic film in Vevey ’82 for his film Vabank (1981)."

Revenge in the House of Usher by Jess Franco",Jess Franco,1983,USA,,International Competition,"Howard Vernon, Antonio Mayans, Lina Romay, Olivier Mathot, Daniel White",,,,,,,93',Horror,,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084592/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_40,NEUROSIS,,,,"Acker takes the confession of his former master, professor Usher, the last descendant of an ancient dynasty that devotes its existence to evil and insanity. Usher tells that he conceived a blind creature when he was a young professor at the university of Prague. It was destined to become his Golem and assist him on his path of evil. 
The famous novella by Edgar Allen Poe ‘The Fall of the House of Usher’ was the inspiration for Neurosis. The professor is brilliantly impersonated by the old-timer in the horror genre: Howard Vernon, who conceptualised the character ‘The Terrible Dr. Orloff’ after playing the title role in The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse by Fritz Lang. A diabolic scientist that can certainly be displayed next to the busts of Mabuse, Jeckyll and Frankenstein."

The scientist in question used human guinea pigs in his lab who displayed the most hideous boils, bulges and deformations after the experiment. The victims of the cruel doctor escape from his lab and settle themselves in the catacombs of the city. They are attracted to a young girl, Nicole, who possesses supernatural powers, and abduct her. Her father is a mobster who is furious about the abduction and he sends one of his best men into the catacomb. But the beautiful Nicole feels more at home in the unhealthy, underground world of her abductors where there is no day or night, than above the ground where hypocrisy and cruelty thrive…
Underworld is a fantastic thriller that will only make the spectator dare to watch it between two fingers. The picture shows a lot of film noir characteristics but at the same time bursts with make-up delights. Peter Litten (April Fool's day, The Last Horror Film), a former disciple of Chris Tucker, is emerging to be a true make-up master."

Their foolery is as innocent as it is dangerous, until the boy falls in love with a young woman. For her he is willing to overcome all dangers and even a diabolic revenge can’t scare the boy away.
Piccoli Fuochi has nothing to do with the abundant and fierce American popcorn-genre for pimpled youngsters: it’s a sensitive and ingenious analysis of the child and his fantasy world. Claudio Argento’s production is directed by Peter Del Monte (L’altra donna and L’ivintation au voyage)."
1986,movie ,Classic Retro,,TWILITH ZONE - THE MOVIE,"John Landis, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante, George Miller",1983,USA,,,"Dan Aykroyd, Albert Brooks, Vic Morrow",,,,,,,101',"Horror, Science-Fiction",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0086491,?ref_=fn_al_tt_1",,,,,"As a tribute to the late tv series The Twilight Zone four film directors who earned their stripes in fantastic put their heads together to sketch out their journey in four stages. A journey through the fifth dimension. The sharp humour and the ruthless ethics by John Landis (Schlock, The Blues Brothers, An American Werewolf in London), makes the spectator shiver with a nightmare that its victim caused it. The magical hand of Spielberg is unquestionably present in the second episode in which the imagery emits an undefined poetic power. A simple yet beautiful story about the dreams of childhood and the nostalgia of being old. The third part that Joe Dante took on himself, introduces a cruel bully, who has a mythical gift that makes it possible for him to accomplish everything he wants. The icing on the cake is without a doubt the episode Nightmare at 20.000 Feet, that is being presented to us by George “Mad Max” Miller. He ingeniously tells us how a passenger with a claustrophobic fear of airplanes slowly goes insane on a Boeing. Claustrophobic horror guaranteed."

He races to his brother and tells him what he has seen, but bumps up against a sneering smile. Offended, he ventures the ominous depths of the tombs all-alone.
With Phantasm Don Coscarelli won the special price of the jury in Avoriaz(’79). His next film became The Beastmaster, in which he showed himself to be a worthy member of the new generation of young directors, led by Spielberg and Lucas."

However when she notices his figure she notices that his body is lacking every human form. She escapes this adventure in one piece… but she will have to recover from the shock in a home for the elderly.
The Howling is important in the history of fantastic film. For one thing it confirmed the talent of Joe Dante who at the time had directed only one film (Piranha) but has delivered quality products ever since. On the other hand The Howling put the spotlights on Bob Bottin’s talent. He accomplished stunning werewolf transformations that made the film notorious."

The Gizmo isn’t allowed to come into contact with water as well as bright light and cannot be fed past midnight. Like it always happens in the movies, Billy does not stick to the rules.
Gremlins is an unusual, cynic Christmas story that seems to be the result of an unlikely marriage between Walt Disney and Tex Avery. Gremlins is a marvellous relaxing cocktail of horror, humour and romantics. A spectacle that will leave the film-fan chuckling with pleasure in his seat as a result of the fast succession of gags and references to Hollywood classics (from E. T. and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Snowwhite). Gremlins is the brainchild of Chris Columbus who also pulled the screenplay for «The Goonies» out of his sleeve. Joe Dante (The Howling, Piranha and It’s a Good Life from The twilight Zone) presents himself as a true master of combining bursts of laughter with cries of distress."

But the information they send the headquarters of the Star Fleet in San Francisco is much more frightening: the mysterious destructive force is penetrating the department of the federation and racing down to planet earth with a speed that is unheard of…
Due to the incredible success of the TV-show Star Trek in the U.S., the producers have been dreaming of an adaptation for the screen. The realisation of this very expensive project fell into the hands of film artist Robert Wise (West Side Story, Audrey Rose, The Andromeda Strain), who trusted the special effects to Douglas Trumbull (2001, Brainstorm, Close Encounters of the Third Kind) and John Dykstra (Star Wars). Their tricks and stage settings give this super production the fairy-like charm of a children’s fairytale."

For these androids there is only one solution to destroy Connor and his guerrilla: interfere with the past and prevent his birth from even happening. In Terminator two classic themes of science fiction are merged together: the coup of the machine and the travel through time. The fierce editing and the diabolic rhythm of action and violence make the film a hallucinating experience.
Terminator, based on a screenplay that is as steady as a rock, was directed by the masterful hand of James Cameron (Piranha II) who mostly made fame with his special effects in Escape from New York. Add the brilliant impersonation by Arnold “Conan” Schwarzenegger (the Cyborg) and Michael Biehn, along with the stunning special effects by Stan Winston (The Thing) and you get an irresistible chunk of raw cinema."

We are located in the heart of a metropolis that is being terrorized by a omnipresent, pompous and outdated mechanism. A ministry of information regulates the daily life of each citizen down to the last detail. In this Kafkaian imperium lives a modest, somewhat dreamy and humble man: Sam Lowry. He’s a hardworking servant at the ministry who doesn’t cherish any ambition and has accepted his desperate life that only becomes interrupted by his heroic and romantic dreams. A smacked fly that ends up in a computer and takes the thing out of order, changes the until then steady life of Sam and turns it into a true nightmare.
Terry Gillian who we already know of Monthy Python’s Flying Circus delivers a masterpiece with both humoristic and gruesome touches. It’s a film that breathes an Orwellian atmosphere and contains unforgettable images. He directed Jabberwocky and Time Bandits, but it’s not until now with Brazil that he expresses himself as a genius sculptor who we cannot miss anymore in the future."

The friendly Alien Robert Preston is bringing him to a far corner of the universe. There he will be a part of the imperial fleet to shoot the disgusting creatures that threaten his highness to eternal hunting grounds.
Starfighter is a film that vibrates with energy. Action and humour are combined in a fantastic way. Nick Castle, who took his first steps into the film world as a screenwriter for John Carpenter (Escape from New York) and made a debut as director with TAG (1982) makes a spectacle out of Starfighter, where the sparks splash of the screen."

Two members of the American team take off to the Norwegian base to ask for an explanation about the events. But the base is completely burned down.
Thirty years after The Thing from Another World John Carpenter made his version one that wants to be more of a sequel than a remake. The director of Halloween and The Fog was aware of every possibility in which his claustrophobic location enabled him to utilize it. Besides, the special effects of The Thing consist of an impeccable virtuosity. Talk about a ghastly thriller."

With her friend Jack, a sensitive and cheerful boy, she ventures into the enchanted forests. But under this paradise, inside the intestines of the earth, hides an evil creature, Darkness, that cherishes the dream to immerse this fairytale world into the darkness of evil.
With Legend Ridley Scott brings a plainspoken homage to Cocteau and Disney, and breaks new ground after his futuristic masterpieces Alien and Blade Runner. Legend is a kaleidoscopic world of whirling dream images, a forest of breathtaking beauty, a constellation of fantastic and allegoric creatures. Ridley Scott has bent the realism and pessimism that characterized his previous films into an epos about the battle between Light and Darkness."

The threesome is on the street but they don’t give up on hope. They decide to collect the needed funds for their vital research themselves and enthusiastically open up their own business that they call Ghostbusters. They kind of form a commando-unit that hunts a very rare wild: ghosts. And, incomprehensible but true, there seems to be a lot of work to do. New York is overflowing with phantoms, forest ghosts, supernatural creatures, and other funny streak loving vermin.
The three Ghostbusters already formed a booming threesome on the immensely successful TV-show The Saturday Night Live Show, in which they performed alongside the mourned John Belushi and the irresistible Eddie Murphy. The threesome in question consists of the unprecedented Bill Murray (The Razor's Edge), the fantastic Dan Aykroyd (Blues Brothers) and the hilarious Harold Ramis. The comedians surpassed the commercial scores of Indiana Jones and the Gremlins in 1984."

The man standing in front of you looks just like Scott, has the same deep voice like Scott, walks in the same way as Scott and also has the familiar clumsy traits like Scott… But it isn’t Scott. Didn’t he die in your arms a few months ago? You did burry him yourself? Is someone fooling you? No, Jenny, you don’t suffer from hallucinations. You are the witness of a strange intergalactic error and your pretty head will never understand it. Don’t throw yourself into the arms of that fool again: somewhere far away in the stars is his home.
Starman is the last film of John Carpenter (Escape from New York, The Thing) in which he introduces an intergalactic traveller called Jeff Bridges, who to his great annoyance is shipwrecked on planet earth. To escape the dumb earth residents to whom he is obviously as dangerous as a runaway mountain gorilla, he will have to take the form of a human, no less than the exact duplicate of Jenny’s deceased husband. We already know Jeff Bridges from Against All Odds, Cutter's Way and Tron, whilst Karen Alles (Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Aftermath) as Jenny, is on her way to become a great star."

One day the ten-year –old discovers an old fairytale book with the appealing title THE NEVER ENDING STORY in an old antique shop. Just by reading the first pages he is being pulled into the whirling and even magical story of the book that describes a fantastic world in which the most amazing creatures are hiding…
Wolfgang Peterson (Das Boot, Enemy Mine), the figurehead of German cinema today, pays a tribute to the human (and children’s in particular) imagination. To bring the fairytale land from Petersens imagination to the screen, the director had united 200 artists and engineers by his side. One of them was Brian Johnson who had already been nominated for the desirable Oscar with films like Alien, The Empire Strikes Back and Dragonslayer. The film demanded a preparation of two years in one of the most modern studios in Europe and has about 300 special effects. But Petersens film is not only a success from a technical point of view. His film radiates a charm that calls for comparisons with the magnificent The Wizard of Oz."

A little over a dozen affected corpses come back to life, crawling out from under their tombstone and start their second youth. But the military intercepts them, locks them into metal containers and secretly stows them away in a warehouse for medical waste, where they are still to be found to this day.
Dan O’Bannon wrote the script for two of the most original Science fiction films of the last years: Alien and Dark Star, and now releases his first long motion picture. Driven by a passion for fantastic and horror, we find a sinister and nihilist sense of humour in all the pictures he collaborated with, and it peaks in Return of the Living Dead. He is also assisted by Bill Munns (Brainstorm and The Beastmaster), one of the greatest experts on prosthesis and special make-up, and by his stage-builder Bill Stout (Conan 1 & 2, Rambo)."

After The Night of the Living Dead Romero was welcomed into the ranks of fantastic film with open arms. Between this film and The Day of the Dead the film that ends the trilogy, he also signed for films like Creepshow and Jack’s Wife. Tom Savini, the inseparable residential make-up artist of Romero since Martin, was able to fulfil his wildest make-up fantasies with this film."

Eleven years later DAWN OF THE DEAD put the horror genre in a new gear due to the bloodthirsty make-up effects by Tom Savini.
DAY OF THE DEAD, the third part of the Romero-trilogy makes your hair stand up once more. The picture is an apocalyptic orgy of chopped up body-parts and bloody intestines."

Arriving at the edge of said constellation, our friends are attacked by monstrously large machines that are accompanied by countless spacecrafts.

Is there a connection between the program put in place by Dr Jordine, which enables the sportsmen and women to increase their performance by administering steroids and chemical stimulants?
Michael Elliot made a nice debut in the world of fantastic with Fatal Games. He got the help from two screenwriters of famous lineage: Raphaël Bunuel and Christopher Makiewicz. Fatal Games was cleverly directed, nicely impersonated and beautifully shot. The film describes an actual theme in a convincing way."

But only moments after they’ve lifted anchor they become the victims of car trouble, whilst Touring Galaxy Aid is nowhere to be seen in light years. They decide that their safest bet is to make an emergency landing on Earth. They end up alongside a highway, where they cause quite a stir. 
Morons from Outer Space is the first comedy by Mike Hodges, who is not a stranger for science-fiction lovers. He is also the spiritual father of ‘The Terminal’ and the last Flash Gordon-film. Morons from Outer Space is an anarchistic and uncontrollable picture, that in no way shows any similarities to his previous films, let alone any other film!"

He is one of the last descendants of the notorious ancestors of cruel and invincible warriors that made Japan so powerful. His attackers will be sorry to have ever been born and will beg to die…
Pray for Death is at the very least another kung-fu-vehicle. This film by Gordon Hessler (The Golden Voyage of Simbad) in which the tension during the last minutes is driven up to unbearable heights, is neither cheap or over the top. Sho Kosugi incarnates the father. His play and his control over the martial arts are so convincing that he will forever be the Ninja to us."

Unfortunately the people are that naive to believe in this fictional ark and make no effort of trying to organise themselves to survive. 
A philosophical parable. They create a myth to save the life on earth and organise it at the same time; a myth that will clearly and ultimately be their downfall. The film O-BI, O-BA will make the viewer think about: religion, mysticism, fanaticism, power, death, war and the total destruction of omnipresent themes in this remarkable Polish production."

Terror in the Ailes invites the viewer to take a look behind the scenes and into the sinister magician’s bag of vicious diabolic artists who usually don’t give up their many tricks.

Watching a film, in which the demons on the screen take their victims from the movie theatre, is diabolic. The screenplay is stopped, the film tape is examined, but the horror continues…
Demoni is undoubtedly the Italian horror film of the eighties. The public will vividly remember certain scenes years later. The director is Lamberto Bava (Blastfighter and Macabro) whilst the producer is no one less than the grand Dario Argento. You immediately notice that the creator of Phenomena and Tenebrae had a lot to say during the filming.

Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce made these two picturesque figures immortal in the classic black and white cinema whilst Peter Cushing and Douglas Wilmer immortalised Doyle’s creations for the BBC-TV. Even Billy Wilder kept himself busy with the distinguished inhabitant of 221B Baker Street and this in the parody tribute ‘The private life of Sherlock Holmes’ with Robert Stephens as the detective. Last but not least Nicolas Meyer brought Sherlock Holmes and Sigmund Freud together in ‘The Seven Percent Solution’. The famous pair discusses the youth of the grand detective and reaches disturbing findings.
The screenplay of this delicious pastiche is by Chris Colombus (Spielberg’s house screenwriter of teenage shenanigans) who has already created the Gremlins and The Goonies. Nicolas Rowe and Anthony Higgins take on the main roles."

This Soviet production retells the ancient myth of Herbert George Wells which has been filmed countless times since James Whale (with Claude Rains as the invisible man). In a typically Slavic way, filmmaker Zakharov tries to show the loneliness of someone who is uniquely endowed and therefore hated and envied by his fellow man. This new film version breathes the English tradition both in style and setting."

BLOOD SIMPLE is without a doubt the best debut film of the last 10 years. The brothers Coen wrote a solid and original screenplay that came out amazing on the screen.
