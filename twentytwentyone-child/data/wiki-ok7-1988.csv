It seems to have very curious properties and emerges a feeling of irrepressible awkwardness.
It is possible to be Catholic and believe in sciences at the same time: the bishop prefers scientists to exorcists and calls in some researchers who, bedecked with their instruments of inspection, will try to unlock the secret of the mysterious small box…
John CARPENTER goes back to his first love: small finances and great results.
“Prince of Darkness is a true-blue movie of terror which takes place in an enclosed universe, following the example of the greatest successes of its author.
We obviously think of Assault on Precinct 13, but also of The Thing. Moreover, Prince of Darkness renews with originality and pleasure the myth of the Antichrist. No extreme piousness, no exorcism, but fear, action, boldness, and boldness again…
CARPENTER is a genius in terms of action directing. From the first fifteen minutes, the audience knows and senses that the impact will be hard, that they will not escape the diabolical expertise of this evil man. The music, once again signed by CARPENTER and Alan HOWARTH, contributes a lot in the tension rise thanks to its repetition and obsession. A soundtrack will rarely have been as pervasive in a fantasy movie. It brings back the urge and the hammering of The Fog and The Thing.
The actors are remarkably guided and, once again, CARPENTER makes use of one of his other qualities: faithfulness. It is a real pleasure to see Donald PLEASENCE (Halloween, Escape from New York) again, but also the actors of the Chinese protagonists from Big Trouble in Little China, Victor WONG and Ann YEN.” – Michel VOLETTI.

But now, things seem to be wasted for good: some real estate developers have decided to make a clean break with their building whatever the cost.
Those five, who had nothing in common, will join forces to defend their home, but without much hope: all the more so as demolition workers, outraged by their resistance to make way for sacrosanct progress, hire a gang leader, who is supposed to harass and bully our protagonists. Don’t get your hopes up: only a miracle or external help can save them! And for their hopeless case, “external” help will come – from far, far away.
Batteries Not Included is the third movie of director Matthew ROBBINS (after Dragonslayer and The Legend of Billie Jean). He first became famous as a screenwriter with his colleague Hal BARWOOD, (MacArthur, The Sugarland Express). From Sugarland to Batteries, the connection is obvious: Steven SPIELBERG who directed the former and produced the latter with his Amblin Entertainment company. So, Batteries is also the crowning achievement of a long (and successful) friendship, adding to this trio George LUCAS’s Industrial Light and Magic, for special effects, which is the finishing touch of this team to an amazing movie.
Starring in Batteries Not Included are the famous lovers (in life as in movies too) Jessica TANDY-Hume CRONYN, whom we already loved in Cocoon."

Together, they look for her and Henri will become, during a fantastic night, Louis’s rival in a movie series where he will fight for Hélène’s love…
While travelling in the Seventh Dimension, from Middle-Age to early-twentieth-century Egypt, he will wait for her, each time with a new look: a mad scientist surrounded by cross-breed monsters, a dream thief-prince, an evil clerk and clever exorcist, a Machiavellian gentleman, or even a grave-defiler explorer…
What if Henry ended up surpassing the master?
In the current jungle of the film-making industry, short films practically have no opportunity to be shown mainstream; yet their directors are the ones who will create tomorrow’s cinema.
Laurent DUSSAUX had the idea of gathering several movies in one full-length feature film: based on a plot developing a coherent story which avoids the classic pitfall of sketched movies, Laurent DUSSAUX and five friends of his got the chance to express themselves in accordance with their own style. 
Two of those young directors are not unknown any more here in the Brussels Fantastic Festival: Stéphan HOLMES who won the Award for Best Short Film in 1984 with Ceux d’en bas and Laurent DUSSAUX whose Le Réacteur Vernet was nominated for the 1986 competition."

He gets out of his car and tries to intervene, but the aggressors brutally tackle him, and things get worse: Mark kills two of the aggressors, the young lady also dies, and he is looking very bad, stained with blood. Only the third aggressor, a woman, ran away in one piece. About to lose consciousness, stumbling Mark wanders along the road in search of some help. When he finally ends in a splendid property, he passes out… and then wakes up in a hospital, with his friend Cheryl beside him.
He cannot remember anything from the aggression. However, he sharply recalls the billionaire, Roderick Bael, as well as two astonishing young girls, Helen and Cleo, who had taken him in… He escapes the hospital to meet them. Bael offers him the opportunity to be immensely rich while Helen and Cleo offer him the perspective of their favours…
Directed by Karl ZWICKY, Contagion follows the lead of excellent movies to which Australia has got us used for several years.
“Based on a complex and original storyline, magnificently pictured and so judiciously performed, along with its actors whose perfect acting emphasises our conviction and confusion towards the topic, Contagion establishes subtle unease and fear, captivating our attention till the unremitting and very violent end.” – L’Écran Fantastique"

She introduces Caleb to her “family”, some young lunatic folks who wonder at night, but hibernate during the day. Caleb does not take too much time to realise that her “family” is composed of vampires only. However, he agrees to take part in their slaughters, until the day the gang leader decides to tackle Caleb’s father and little sister. He will have to double-cross and then slaughter the vampire horde…
“Near Dark wants to renew the vampirism theme with an important emphasise on scenery and photography and with an ever-present action in the Mad Max and Terminator way: in the middle of the country, vampires attack houses and farms while riding their motorbikes.
Extremely violent and bloody, this movie reminds of works such as the ones by Walter HILL, Brian DE PALME and Sam PICKINPAH.
And the music is ‘Tangerine Dream’!” – Robert MOUTIER
“In Near Dark, there is an oppressive atmosphere worthy of Tobe HOOPER’s first movies: a lot of emotions, even pathos. A unique work, simply played by actors who are as sweet as Lance HENRIKSEN (the Aliens android).” – Alain PETIT"

His bosom buddy, Fred, is specialised in special effects. Together, they should have it all tied up in Hollywood! But their horror movies are all flops, and they don’t even manage to earn enough money for their last project. At this point, only some serious help from destiny can save them. And now, Warren’s uncle just kicked the bucket, assigning his nephew as his only heir. Over the moon, both men evaluate the considerable amount which saves them at the very last moment; but this legacy is all in all composed of a pawned old case: to get it back, they first have to pay twenty dollars and twenty-five cents. At first, the content of the case is disappointing: just some pictures of Warren’s uncle, a former movie director from the 20s, and a clock no longer usable. Warren, miffed, is still going to repair the clock, and that’s where he is going to estimate his legacy’s wealth!
Ghost Chase was directed by Roland EMMERICH (Joey), the German SPIELBERG of fantasy movies, and presents itself as a ghost train, horrible and beautiful at the same time, where the audience will have mixed feelings between terror and hilarity.
Jason LIVELY (Brainstorm, Night of the Creeps) is the one playing Warren, and Jill WITHLOW (Porky’s), as Laurie, is the director’s girlfriend, also starring Paul GLEASON (Trading Places, The Breakfast Club)."
1988,movie ,International Competition,,RETRIBUTION by Guy Magar,Guy Magar,1986,USA,Belgian Premiere,International Competition,"Dennis Lipscomb, Leslie Wing, Suzanne Snyder",,,,,,,107',"Horror, Mystery",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0095984,?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_15",,,,,"Being a looser, like George Miller is, in a country where individuals are condemned to success can only lead to a deadly end. George Miller has decided to speed things up and suicides himself… But he’s stuck with bad luck and his way out is a failure: he ends up with a swollen face and paralysed legs in a hospital, in a female doctor’s compassionate hands, who freshly graduated and is thus still nurturing all her illusions.
When George Miller failed his suicide, another looser who was born on the same day as him left this old world, burnt alive by some vindicative game partners who had not forgiven him for not having honoured his debts. And in aid of a sordid and fortuitous arrangement, both incidents are going to mix up together, forcing the survivor to relentlessly get his revenge.
Without knowing that he is the bearer of a punishment respecting the law of retaliation, the painter’s daubed universe will be coloured with blood red and his illustrator fingers will turn into criminal hands.
“Actually, these cases of post-mortem possessions aren’t new in cinema. We have to admit that they even abound… But all the same, you need ways and means to transmit criminal powers with delicacy.
New in cinema, Guy MAGAR, from TV series, gives the impression that he perfectly controls his topic. The story is told with concision, attention to detail and division which aren’t common things any more these days…
Concise, captivating and remarkably played, Retribution should effortlessly be the start of a new production society that Guy MAGAR has just staged, this new high manipulator of horror who has already no fewer than five new projects at home!” – Norbert MOUTIER
“Guy MAGAR seemed keen to avoid any cliché in terms of imagery and screenplay. The amazing staging manages to create a real climate of tension, of underlying violence perfectly sustained by Alan HOWARTH’s stressful score, who is John CARPENTER’s regular composer.” – Marc TOULLEC"
1988,movie ,International Competition,,AMERICAN GOTHIC,John Hough,1987,UK,Belgian Premiere,International Competition,"Sarah Torgov, Terence Kelly, Mark Erickson",,,,,,,90',Horror,,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0094642,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4",,,,,"Cynthia and her friends, although not clerks, instantly noticed that the middle-aged couple receiving them is very peculiar: their house seems straight from the 20s (no power, no phone), “Pa” only talks in a religious way, and “Ma” treats them as prepubescent children.
At first, the atmosphere was great (they were offered some delicious traditional pie), but then it quickly became strange if not morbid. “Ma” introduced them to their “young” daughter, 30 at the least, 100 kg, white ankle socks, flounced skirts, braids with bow ties… This family, which also has two monstrous “young sons”, turns out little by little to be fanaticised in the utmost respect of the strictest religion: the tyrannical father retains his little family in the most complete conservatism and only has one concern – pulling vice and depravity out from perverted youth… and for him, Cynthia and her friends are the prime example of this!
After a short incursion in whimsical fantasy movies (with Biggles, presented in the presence of its director during the fifth festival), John HOUGH goes back to the genre that built his reputation all in all: horror. He is indeed the author, among others, of the very famous The Legend of Hell House (1973) and The Incubus (1982). And as always, fear which is customary in his movies comes more from the strangeness and deepness of the characters rather than from the violence of the action, still ever-present throughout the movie.
Rod STEIGER is the one who successfully plays the ecclesiastical and paranoid father, Yvonne DE CARLO (The Ten Commandments) is the disturbing mother, and Cynthia, whose shaky personality will give our perfect little family such a hard time, is played by Sarah TORGOV."

Once his desperate act is accomplished, he suicides himself, leaving only one survivor behind – Orwitz, the couple’s child.
Forty years later, Orwitz, diabetic like his father, is living his last moments in a hospital bed. Perfectly still with his eyes closed, pale Orwitz is still fully energetic… Because in the city, four people go through some odd trances from which they wake up disoriented, without any memory of them. And even though they never met each other or Orwitz, they have an irrepressible drive and start their way towards some villa, the very one crime scene…
This discerning story full of parapsychologist powers, which takes place in the stuffy air of a small provincial town where the increasing Nazism begins to be unpleasantly felt, was created and remarkably put on by Jacek KOPROWICZ – this is only his second full-length feature film.
KOPROWICZ, 41 years old, first found interest in philosophy and photography before throwing himself into theatre direction and production. His first movie, The Destiny, was out in 1983."

To do so, he just needs to find the talisman which balances the Good and Bad Forces and was stolen from him a hundred years before. The MONSTER SQUAD only has 48 hours to prevent it from falling into the earl’s hands…
When producing The Monster Squad, Fred DEKKER, already in charge of the notable Night of the Creeps (the most successful movie during the 1987 Festival), was the head of an array of actors of which few of them had reached puberty. Yet it seems as if he was the most childlike of all! With an extravagant imagination, he brought back to life each and every universal evil creature and monster, from werewolves to mummies, via the creature from the Black Lagoon. But it is indeed one perk of being a cinematographic vampire!
For the sake of his new movie, DEKKER appealed to Duncan REGEHR, the Canadian actor, a.k.a. the “Visitor” chief in the American television series “V”. For this new Dracula, no strange accent, no bloody canines, but a very little aristocratic DracuLeeLugosi: bestial but smooth, vicious but full of humour!"

They know that the air on the island is infected and that it could kill them.
They are watched through video cameras and microphones permanently. The light and temperature in the house are remotely controlled from outside. The orders they are given are transmitted through speakers, but it is impossible for the volunteers themselves to communicate with the outside world.
The Operation Dead End goes exactly as planned at first. But soon, fear, loneliness, and the constant tension to which they are subjected force the volunteer guinea pigs to free their hostility and emotions they contained until then. They feel the death threat coming from the island and the house carry weight on them and they decide to put an end to the experiment.
Ignoring the aversion and violence rise and the outburst of passion deliberately, it is decided in high places to carry on the Operation Dead End regardless of the tested subjects or even their life.
This excellent thriller by Nicki MULLERSCHON throws us in an every-day and very (too) current science-fiction; even though it takes place on an ecological background, it mostly deals in a very Kafkaesque way with the role of free will for people of the year 2000 – an appropriate role."

This is a gold mine for Katherine who, during her investigation, is lucky enough to bump into OLDFIELD’s historian. Supporting evidence, he is going to explain that the village itself gives rise to madness and horror. In a whisper, he tells her the story of Stanley Burnside, a frustrated to the core psychopath, who will kick himself because he broke some fundamentals of the perfect womaniser; the one of Jesse Hardwicke, the traitor, who will forever regret wanting to know the secrets of eternal life; the one of one circus artist’s digestive problems who ate glass; the one of the confederate deserter who was captured by a bunch of horrible kids with an alarming diet…
But who will tell the story of the historian himself then, when his whisper turns into a dying scream?
From a Whisper to a Scream is the first full-length feature film of Jeff BURR. Winner of several awards for his short films, BURR reckons that a good fantasy movie first must be based on a clever scenario and character description rather than bloody special effects. Indeed, he included a lot of imagination and (dark) humour in his movie and the four sketches are connected by a simple link, without any phantasmagoric mushiness. For that matter, it is the quality of the storyline which allowed BURR to gather a prestigious cast together: Vincent PRICE is the erudite historian, Glu GULAGER (The Return of the Living Dead, Invaders from Mars, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge) stunningly plays the necrophiliac psychopath, Martine BESWICK (Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde) is Katherine the murderer, and Susan TYRELL (Forbidden Zone, Fat City) is a journalist with dark ambitions."

He says that his name is RANTES and that he comes from another planet. Doctor Denis, chief of the psychiatric unit, is used to seeing lots of aliens, spirits and ghosts haunting the corridors of the clinic. At first, he is going to take RANTES for a faker, but bit by bit, his interest in this man’s “disease” which turns out to be peculiar arouses…
First, the investigation carried out to find the man’s origins leads to nothing: not even a clue or some information about his former life. Then, the tests and results conducted on RANTES put him in the “genius” category. Finally, Doctor Denis feels particularly concerned about RANTES’s mission in which he says he is involved on Earth, that is to say solving the mysteries of the human-feeling mechanism. He says himself doesn’t feel anything, he is just a holographic image sent from space and supplied by his planet through computer intelligence. Doctor Denis, with his feeling “disorder”, praises the RANTES’s case… When this is solved, the only and much more alarming “case” left he will need to take care of will be his…
Man Facing Southeast tells the story of the relationship between two men and of their truths’ impact: the doctor will not rest until he proves RANTES’s madness, out of fear of being forced to consider a reality he refuses to acknowledge and to do some soul-searching.
Imagined and directed by the Argentinian Eliseo SUBIELA, this movie has already been nominated in several festivals and won a very impressive number of awards: International Critics’ Prize in the Toronto International Film Festival; Golden Shell at the San Sebastián International Film Festival; Jury’s Special Prize at the Cartagena Film Festival; Best Film and Best Script at the San Pablo Festival; and three important awards at the Havana Film Festival."

Yes, that is what you saw! Now, take a look at your neighbour who is a bit too dynamic beside you. Could it be John who is getting ready to savagely remove your eyes? You won’t believe your eyes!
Anguish, directed by the Catalan Bigas LUNA, is a Russian doll – a movie in another movie – of truths that erase other ones.
The movie “contains ingenious treasures to embarrass its audience at the most. It is impossible to see whether the show is happening on screen or in reality. It is an ever-approved phenomenon. We knew that Bigas LUNA was capable of establishing heavy and oppressive atmospheres (Caniche), but not that he was so good at manipulation. It is a bit as if fiction consumed the real world, as if the big screen had no more limits. Nothing like Demons by the BAVA/ARGENTO duo.” – Marc TOULLEC

We were waiting in delight that our kind little scamp ventures to reopen CREEPSHOW’s script… and we are not disappointed! There are three stories this time: the revenge of an Indian chief statue… better than the real thing; the trap set for some swimmers by a viscous and above all violent field; and the pursuit a quite embittered car driver engaged in to find a woman who was dishonest and walked past him without stopping to ask him how he was doing…
Here is how Stephen King’s macabre humour strikes again, even more, and for our own enjoyment, revised and edited by George A. ROMERO who was inspired by King for these scenarios. And as the director, Michael GORNICK, threw himself into his movie so wholeheartedly that the audience does not even have time to get bored”…  In comparison to the first Creepshow, “it feels as if this one is more rigorous, which in a way gives a sometimes more inevitable and therefore more convincing nature to the different stories. The excessive nature of the situations always helps give them a certain aspect of King’s inspiration, though we never clearly know if it is humour, parody or seriousness – an ambiguity which is all the more charming.” – Bertrand BORIE"

Brian is 20 years old and is an average boy. Elmer, however, who lives in the same building and in the sink of an old couple, is a vaguely reptilian creature of about 1,000 years old, whose origins must come from South America, somewhere from the Reconquista. As centuries went by, he ended up in the house of some elderly, eccentric couple from New York. With some quite old-fashioned education, very polite, Elmer is often hungry and his feverish and insatiable appetite is only satisfied with one meal: human brains. To do so, Elmer needs someone to carry him from juicy to twitching brains. And he just had his heart set on Brian…
“Brain Damage is the new and long-awaited Frank HENENLOTTER (Basket Case), a very surprising and unique work with an innovative scenario which it would be criminal (as well as complicated) to try and sum up in a nutshell. Just know that Brain Damage is destined to become a huge classic of tomorrow’s: a potential cult movie, with some classic pieces and some bits of bravery which will stay in your memory. In-between John WATERS and Stuart GORDON (Re-Animator), HENENLOTTER asserts himself as a master of bad taste, a full-fledged author.” – Alain PETIT
Brain Damage is “monumental. True to his reputation of underground author falling into sarcasm, bad taste and excessiveness, Frank HENENLOTTER put on show the maddest sequences there are. And the special effects match: they are dirty, explosive, dripping and seeping – their creator?

He comes together again with his aged parents and his little brother who is now five years older than him. He naturally becomes of high interest for scientists, who study him; his memory contains treasures of information. Actually, David wondered for eight years in stardust!
No one will ever see the aliens who kidnapped David: at the most will they be judged for their superior intelligence through the computer which controls the spaceship-taxi, omniscient, psychologist, which has a very serious dose of humour and even allows itself to be sentimental! As for the ship itself, it does not at all look like the broken-down monsters from Star Wars and Star Trek…
You must probably be sick of kids who hang around with robots, invaders or computers; and rightly so! Still, you should see Flight of the Navigator, one of the best surprises of 1987 Cannes market. Extremely well performed, offered with original special effects and “design”, based on a very inventive storyline and full of humour, it was successfully directed by Randal KLEISER, who is not used to this category: light years went by between this movie and his previous film makings (Grease, The Blue Lagoon).

The tendency would rather be bloodthirsty brutes, wandering in the devastated surroundings like harmful monsters…
We know very little about this movie which will be a world premiere during the sixth Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, but it aroused our interest straightaway: it is indeed a Belgian man, Carl COLPAERT, who directed this American movie! Cal CORPAERT was born in Belgium, he studied economics at the KU Leuven and then at the I.N.RA.CI, where he graduated in 1981 to complete his education at the University of California in Los Angeles. He obtained an art degree in 1984 and was hired by Roger CORMAN (himself) for whom he was first hired in post-production. Ever since, he has been working for New World Pictures (Creepshow 2, Vamp, Blakc Moon Rising, The Philadelphia Experiment, Android) for which he just produced In the Aftermath, an apocalyptic tale with violence, fantasy, terror and hope.

And his mother effectively comes back; at first, in her own body, but then with someone else’s face. Soon, other “dead people” will tend to reappear too, because some space bodies of light incarnate some human corpses and their souls as well…
But here there is no terror, quite the opposite: a beautiful love story, full of poetry and very touching, in the tradition of works such as Somewhere in Time, a tale which very cleverly matches a classical sci-fi theme with the traditional myth of the living dead. This time, it’s for the best! Everything is freshly said with nuances, without neglecting the necessary plot twists which make the plot line sweet, and even often moving.
A touch of erotism discreetly brings colour to the story, so does a faraway reflexion which, without ever hanging heavy in the movie or making it rambling, often makes it seem like a philosophical tale and prevents it from falling into silliness. For sure, the lovers of macabre and fantasy in the Italian way, who could have shown contempt for Claudio ARGENTO’s presence in the credits (as a producer), will get little for their efforts. However, those who love romance and beautiful stories will have no reason to complain and will find their delight increased by Angelo BRANDUARDI’s lovely music which well prettily lights up this match of wonder, fantasy and science-fiction.” – Bertrand BORIE

But Donny is not a simple man: as a former soldier, his nights are scattered with nightmares made of machine gun fires. Donny “flirts” with madness and Mara feels betrayed in her dreams of worry-free ideal life.

With her lover’s help, she will lead Donny to suicide… But, there again, reality betrays her desires and, as the first comeback of destiny, she is stuck with a catatonic husband!...
This psychological thriller, where the real victim among all characters is revealed at the very last second, was directed by Gilbert CATES (One Summer Love, The Promise) and gathers a very attractive cast: Karen ALLEN (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Starman) is Mara, the wife who desperately tries to keep her life under control; Keith CARRADINE (The Duellists, Maria’s Lovers, Trouble in Mind) is the man who is behind all the mystery; Jeff FAHEY (Silverado, Psycho III) is the husband who evidently draws the attention on his problems anyway; and Dinah MARROFF (Grease, Ordinary People) is the husband’s devoted little sister."

Images rule, they control everything, from fashion to human behaviours.
A former model, Diane Thornton, reigns on this photographic world: to take pictures, she uses a computer-connected camera. During her last shots, she went very far to picture brief instants of originality with her models, which made her very famous. Hardly everyone is attracted to Diane, but it seems that she inspires some people to have a passion which leads them to make their worship sublime in a series of particularly wicked sacrifice rituals.
Some girls are found dead, hands and feet tied up, right in front of video monitors which play the recording of their last moments…
According to Piccio RAFFANINI, the movie’s director, Obsession: A Taste for Fear could be described as an erotism-crossed rock thriller where “the real star is the setting, the image in every sense. What’s its main topic? Photorealism – inspired by the RanXerox graphic novel series, in which everything is twisted, even sex.” Piccio RAFFANINI, considered to be the greatest music video director of Italy, managed to gather a seducing cast to support his main star: the character of Diana Thornton, the sensual photographer, is played by Australian model Virginie HEY (The Living Daylights and Mad Max 2), her former husband is played by Gérard DARMON (Betty Blue).
The movie’s cinematographer, Romano ALBANI, had already worked on Dario ARGENTO’s movie, Phenomena.

Using the actors’ play to the maximum, Spock-NIMOY, the director, stamps onto this fourth episode a cheerful impulse which approaches in certain scenes the wild tone of a Blake EDWARDS. The outfit, the weird behaviour of the men from the future, and to be completely honest, their complete anachronism in the noisy, primitive and paranoid contemporary city gives us a burlesque tale of very welcomed jokes.
That’s probably why Paramount finally reconnected with the fabulous success that the TV series on the NBC channel was: in only ten days, the movie had almost made 38 million dollars of revenues and collected the positive critics:
“The most exciting and cheering voyage of the famous crew. The Trekkies (fans of the series) will be delighted, and the others charmed by the movie which contains a lot of hilarious moments.” – Hollywood Reporter;
“Leonard Nimoy’s directing has a sincerity that is impossible to miss and wins support. And in adding her a piece of frivolity, he helps inject a new longevity to the series” – New York Times;
“The best movie of the series.” – Sneak Previews;

Months after the release of House, S. CUNNINGHAM, the producer, said: “House was as successful abroad, it was also a hit where nobody expected it to happen.” In the cinema industry, such a statement could only mean one thing: a sequel… A sequel! Oh no?!
It’s Ethan WILEY, House’s screenwriter, who got the director position for the present sequel: “We thought it would be stupid to use the same characters as, dramatically speaking, Roger Cobb had solved his problems in the first movie. Certainly we could have found a shaky reason to make him live new adventures, but it would not have been usable. That’s why I preferred creating a new story, with new protagonists and even, why not, a new house: the purpose was to recreate the spirit of the previous movie, this unique mix of horror and humour, this certainty that each door opens to an unknown world…”
What a relief! House II: The second Story is not a repetition nor a remake of the first movie, its script is totally original: even if it keeps the spirit of the first part, a cocktail of humour and horror, the first one is clearly honoured without turning it into a parody for all that: Chris WALAS was entrusted with the special effects for that matter, and his impressive talent already shone in numerous famous movies: The Fly, Enemy Mine, Scanners, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and above all, Gremlins."

But nothing – neither in the decoration nor in the full to breaking out wardrobes – seems to be from after the 50s. It is a bargain for our friends who quickly immerse themselves in the atmosphere of the premises: they change their outfit and explore in pair “their” new estate which, although empty, seems inhabited by a strange presence – a rockabilly group attracts them in a show room but disappear when they arrive… They are the audience of a movie screening, without anyone behind the projector or any movie in the reels…
And what seems to be a welcoming dwelling at first will turn out to be a terrible and viscous trap: in the horror hotel, you will be able to have a look outside whenever… but you will never be able to leave!
Norman J. WARREN is a specialist of horror movies and tightrope at the same time. During the blockbuster era, he was only granted with leftovers: which did not prevent him from directing already more than a dozen movies, among which Inseminoid (1981) was more successful than expected.
Once again, with Bloody New Year, we can feel that the director struggled to make ends meet, but it did not prevent him from brightening the splatter scenes up with his “space-time terror” of special effects, which are often very inventive."

Based on a story which owes a lot to comics, Steve De Jarnatt, a film director from the “Alfred Hitchcock Presents” TV series, directed an ambitious first feature film, of which the main interest is not the cast, but indeed Mélanie Griffith, this splendid call girl in Body Double who plays the bounty hunter who will mentor Sam (David Andrews).

Thirsty of power, he commits misdeed after misdeed and defies powerless human police officers, who do not realise that some curse is going to afflict the Earth…
They can only report a strange (and contagious?) madness that recently affects some peaceful citizens of Los Angeles: Jack De Vries, an orderly businessman at first, gently robs his bank, shooting down the guardians. He runs away in a Ferrari and, as he is followed by an army of policemen, he decides not to let himself get caught, he ploughs into the police roadblock and explodes the Ferrari! In agony, he is sent to the nearest hospital… Half an hour later, another man, with a heart disease, gets out of the hospital, steals a Ferrari and…
What a strange disease that is this killing spree added to an unrestrained taste for expensive cars!
After the famous Alone in the Dark and the wrongly underestimated A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge, Jack SHOLDER follows the example of David CRONENBERG with The Hidden, a movie where the organic horror takes the lion’s share… And it had more luck than Shivers, because The Hidden won the 88 Grand Prix of Avoriaz.
Based on a script by Jim KOUFF (Class, Stakeout), The Hidden tells the story of an intergalactic settling of scores where the issue is no less than peace on Earth. It’s Kevin YAGHER (Cocoon, A Nightmare on Elm Street and A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge, Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter) who was in charge of the special effects, among which there are only two sequences with some elaborated effects; but these two are the most intense moments of the movie! Six characters (including a dog) will customise one at a time the extraterrestrial “criminal”. Only one character is the “embodiment” of the extraterrestrial who is supposed to stop the criminal: it’s Kyle McLAUCHLAN (Dune and Blue Velvet by David LYNCH).

Today, despite her blue-blood, Helietta Canins isn’t called a princess any more, but she is not ready to forget her family’s terrible past: an enigmatic sarcophagus, hidden in the palace cellars, is there to remind her of it. Helietta is persuaded that, in the sarcophagus, lies Nosferatu, and she only wants to move its top to kill the vampire, get revenge for her family and get rid of an abominable plague at the same time. Despite everything, she is not totally unaware of the abominable dangers and consequences that would cause such a hasty initiative: so, she calls Paris Catalano, a major English expert, in the hope of him helping her to successfully complete her “mission” …
The beautiful woman and the savant will soon understand what “being immortal” really means…
Augusto CAMINITO, first and above all a producer (for SORDI’s and FULCI’s movies), now had an off-screen job with Vampire in Venice. He did spare no expense to make his first movie: you can clearly see it in terms of plastic, but even more in terms of cast. Let’s see: Klaus KINSKI doesn’t have to force himself any more to be Nosferatu, whose morbid interest for beautiful creatures is more sensual than ever; Christopher PLUMMER (The Sound of Music, Dreamscape) gives us the image of a less crazy savant than usual; and Donald PLEASANCE (a guest of the 1986 Festival), who definitely seems to be fond of cassocks (Prince of Darkness), successfully plays a sneaky and cowardly confessor."

Both retired, they enjoy some days without complications in their elegant cottage. A great tenderness unites this couple, who respects the traditions of England and of its institutions.
One day, they discover that the world is about to go on a nuclear war. Jim and Hilda do not really understand. They can think about the enemy breaking into their home or some tanks invading the city, but a nuclear war? Suddenly, their radio crackles: a call. There’s only three minutes left before the explosion. Jim is terrified and gets angry, while Hilde is hastening into the garden to take off the laundry…
Directed according to the comics of Raymond BRIGGS, this animation movie deals with a serious topic: the refusal to think about the real consequences of a nuclear explosion. Jim and Hilda are so naive it is almost exasperating, the picture is straight and flawless, but they are still keeping us on tenterhooks for more than an hour. They live small things; they intensify tiny details of their daily life. The character animation also clings to a triviality: Jim who raised eyebrows, supposing a doubt. In other sequences, the designers’ talent overflows and reaches its climax in the explosion scenes.
This impressive movie, out of which you barely survive, won the Annecy Cristal for a Feature Film in 1987. The music is from Roger WATERS and the soundtrack is sung by David BOWIE."

That’s when he transfixes his victim and makes them pay their ride with a precise bite.
His victims then join his horde of fiancés, all over New York, who cut their teeth on poor admirers while waiting for their master’s visits…
But Stephen is too sensitive: his meeting with Michèle, the exact copy of the love of the vampire’s life, will shake his habits up and lead him to death…
Directed with a great sensibility by Gérard CICCORITTI, Graveyard Shift is way more than a simple horror movie. This original work, in content as well as in style, along with violent lights and full of really sweet characters, deals with the vampirism theme in a very original way. The night creature is presented here as a pathetic and lost solitary being who is always in the grip of life torments, to such an extent that we eventually start to feel empathy for it.
“Graveyard Shift stands out above all for his technical directing, which reveals the director’s talent, evidently very inspired by the current images. Remarkably pictured and filmed in the way of a movie clip, Graveyard Shift seduces with his style and his astonishing editing.” – Cathy CARANI."

When it was released in Great Britain, The Magic Toyshop, adapted from the novel by Angela CARTER, the author of The Company of Wolves which was brought on screen by Neil JORDAN, gained some enthusiastic critics:
“Despite its title, it is not a movie for kids, but a tale for adults. It is obsessive and disturbing at the same time in its mix of supernatural dreams and depressing realism.” – Variety
“This beautiful breath-taking movie never stops being pleasing to the eye.” – Screen International
“An enchanting and magic movie.” – Vogue
“The Magic Toyshop is certainly one of the strangest and richest movies of the English cinema of the last few years. It is way more captivating and discerning than The Company of Wolves by Neil JORDAN.” – Q Magazine"

As a student and assistant of Andréi TARKOVSKI, Constantin LOPOUCHANSKI draws with Dead Man’s Letters the unbelievable portrait of a slaughtered humanity, victim of its own madness, with the messy reflexions of an old scientist whose Nobel Prize is useless now.
As the movie was out some time before the Chernobyl disaster, it caused a scandal in the Soviet Union.

She is welcomed very coldly by her mother, who hurries to hide the kids from the bad-tempered father: if he comes to find out that his daughter, finally “done” with her good-for-nothing husband, has on top of that (!!) four children, he might definitively clear her, of the house and of her rights!

Something that Grandmother does not accept happily: sadistic and sanctimonious, she hastens to hide those “sins” in the attic. The children are put in the hands of a real tyrant, confined in their attic-jail, under the permanent surveillance of a silent and threatening guard: if they ever tried to escape, they would have to cross the garden, the hunting ground of an enormous bloody Doberman…
The kids’ only joyful moments are when they are given caster-sugar-sprinkled “cookies”, served with their grub, and when Corrine visits them, every time more beautiful with a better outfit, who promises them that she will soon take them away. Soon. But the visits start to be less frequent, and the four flowers of the attic perish…
From an American best-seller by V.C. ANDREWS, Flowers in the Attic was adapted and directed by the screenwriter (Farewell, My Lovely) and filmmaker (The Stick Up) Jeffrey BLOOM. This tragedy with a fantasy and unhealthy atmosphere, very close to the poisonous The Innocents, was a real hit in the US and is supremely played by Louise FLETCHER (One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Strange Invaders, The Lady in Red, Brainstorm…) as the devil grandmother, and Victoria TENANT (The Holcroft Covenant, All of Me, Best Seller) as Corrine, a rather greedy than loving mother."

“The TV series director Robert BIERMAN’s first movie Apology won the Grand Prix from the Audience award at the Festival du Film Policier de Cognac. Série noire of the best tradition, but also an excellent B movie (the movie has all the characteristics), Apology skilfully combines psychological and anxious thriller with police investigation. But here, no bloodshed, no violence, no sensational gunshots. No brutal pursuit nor spectacular stunts. The director particularly pays attention to his characters, enjoying the performance of Lesley Anne WAREN (Burglar) and Peter WELLER (The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, Of Unknown Origin, RoboCop), and builds around them (and the audience) a spiderweb in which they will struggle to live eventually. Both protagonists, one is an artist and the other is a detective, prisoners from their past and their frustrations, are alike. Behind Lily’s creative energy, we perceive the despair of the “incomplete” (a failed marriage, a not very brilliant art career); under Rad Hungate’s unshakeable mask, hides a solitary man, lost and similar to some certain characters of Humphrey BOGART.” – Daniel SCOTTO."

Fred WALTON with When a Strange Calls had already shown his extraordinary gift for pure terror directing: without reaching his first movie’s climax for all that, The Rosary Murders is completely immersed in a very captivating, obsessional atmosphere served with a very clever (suspense is present throughout the whole movie) and often original script. His way of bringing and then filming the murders (while avoiding useless violence), the omnipresence of violent death, and the murder religiousness make it an excellent movie on the edge of fantasy.
In this mixed atmosphere, the directing evolves with ease and leans on the nuanced act of Donald SUTHERLAND (M*A*S*H, Fellini’s Casanova, Invasion of the Body Snatchers)."

1988,guest,Guest of honor,,,"Richard, Fleischer",,USA,,"In “Le Film Noir Américain”, François GUERIF gives an absolutely right definition of Richard FLEISCHER: “the last Hollywood dinosaur for some, the last ‘yes-man’ for others, because he agrees to play anything and everything, the only problem is: with some exceptions, he does so with a remarkable talent”.
Richard FLEISCHER started in 1946 within RKO Pictures with some small, overexcited thrillers which today still have an unquestionable poetic power: streets wet from rain, at night, in unusual places, with neon lights, all of it underlined by an admirable black and white picture – Follow Me Quietly in 1949, The Narrow Margin in 1952… When he started working for 20th Century Fox, he showed his talent thanks to the highest budgets: Violent Saturday in 1955, Between Heaven and Hell in 1956…
In United Artists, he directed an attractive western: Bandito in 1956 with Robert MITCHUM, and The Vikings in 1958 with Kirk DOUGLAS. In 1966, with Fantastic Voyage (starring Raquel WELCH and Donald PLEASANCE), he took an interest in science-fiction and fantasy: he directed Doctor Dolittle in 1967, the impressive The Boston Strangler in 1968 (with Tony CURTIS), the terrifying See No Evil (starring Mia FARROW), the unforgettable Soylent Green in 1973 with Charlton HESTON. Overall, Richard FLEISCHER directed more than 50 movies and he never slowed down his job. Here are some of his latest movies: Amityville 3-D in 1983, Red Sonja in 1984 and Conan the Destroyer also in 1984.",,,,,,,,,,Director,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,name,nm0281507,?ref_=fn_al_nm_1",,,,,

It is in the early 70s that he discovered his passion for fantasy movies: he directed, among others, Ceremonia sangrieta in 1973, Violent Blood Bath also in 1974 with Fernando REY, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie in 1974, which is as good as ROMERO’s and FULCI’s zombies (for that matter, Jorge GRAU’s movies have always had troubles with censorship), La siesta in 1976, La leyenda del tambor in 1981…",,,,,,,,,,Writer,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,name,nm0336076,",,,,,

She was a founding member of the “Cuesmes 68” group and made wall paintings across Belgium with them.
Since 1979, she has presented her sculptures via personal exhibitions and has participated in group demonstrations in Belgium and abroad. “A realist, an expressionist, in direct contact with nature which she studies with a sharp, stubborn and subjective eye, Paule HERLA flows her turbulent modelling in epoxy resins.
It is a material with modern sensitivity which, unlike bronze and marble, is not attractive at first.
It is a material which tells the truth, reveals the flaws of volume, and then requires an extra style, density and balance of expressivity. Paule HERLA sands it, paints it, treats its and mistreats it because of its specificity of ascetical plastic.” – Pauline ANDREA.

1988,event,Art Exhibition,,,"Emaillerie, Belge",,,,"Enamel is the result of fire. To begin with: silica, boron, and fluorine. And then: fire. A beautiful harmony. Lava is bluntly cooled down and then blows up: is it alchemy or sciences?
The magic of art brings them together. The magic of fire then allows glass and iron to blend foolishly. The art of enamelling is a technique where the Vulcan spirit lingers: from one firing to another, one colour never stays the same. It is even said that the moon plays tricks on enamellers.
Enamel is a jewel, an image, a functional object. In 1985, it becomes very pleasant to the eye. Hergé – father of the adventure comics – and Tintin – pioneer of the moon conquest – introduced this series of decorative enamelled plates. A world premiere. A topic as symbolic as striking. A project which lends credibility to its frame.

No, a fantasy of fancies.
To charm with outrage or to outrage with charm?
A pleasing pleasure or a joker’s joke?
A profane eye?
No, a funny wink.
A double emotion or a fleeting stampede?
An artist spin or a crazy frenzy?
No, a desire to go on dreaming and to escape critics.
To mark the eye and to twist imagination.
To discover an undiscovered pleasure while demystifying the body.

Born in 1949, this Italian has been living and working in Belgium since 1960. He made his first important works from 1979.
His last pieces are:
“Art Foot” (1986), Tubize, an eight-metre Platini, a goalkeeper and his goal, a scream; at the Hall des Foires in Courtrai: five monumental sculptures through a glass roof.
“Des Images pour le dire” (1987) at the Vènerie cultural centre, a look on a revolution.
“Articulture 2”, in the avenue of Mariemont, a duel between two men for the beautiful Mauricette.
“His own pleasure is to sculpt some synthetic foam blocks with a chainsaw. But he fears easy savagery and violence. He prefers tension that comes from muscles, from curves that tighten and stretch. After some work with his chainsaw, he sands it all to underline the quality of movement that he solidifies in stratifying before painting it to create new tensions between painted movement and sculpted movement. A rhythmic painting which revives the body movements, confronts directions, multiplies metaphors while marking the sculpted demonstrability. Because the narration did not stop with the sculpture, it resumed with greater intensity with colour.” – Alain de WASSEIGE

His funny work is nonetheless useful. His literally sensational toys match the prime products of all early cultures, the ones that were first discovered in archaeological digs: idols, dismantled effigies of old mechanical myths or symbols of primary passions, items; tools, recovered furniture or musical instruments with undefined scales; ornaments, sets of jewels for the body or armours, which presume a hardened skin and a dangerous, oxidant environment.
There’s one common thing to all these toys: they don’t do for themselves. Although they can be admiring for the idol’s, tool’s, ornament’s inherent beauty, which is real; although their natural look can seduce, their true value lies in the way they work, whether they need the visitor’s involvement.
