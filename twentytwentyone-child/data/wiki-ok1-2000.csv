Bruno, shoot each other in the middle of a live
TV show. Flashback to the early seventies. Nino is a
night-club singer who performs covers; badly.
Bruno is a struggling comedian vying for a break.
Julian, a sleazy showbizz agent, brings them
together. During the course of a live talent contest,
Nino freezes. Bruno responds by slapping him and
thus is born a comedy routine that propels them to
stardom. Nino then falls in love with Laura, but loses
her to Bruno. She becomes the catalyst for the
rivalry-jealousy-hatred that springs up between
Nino and Bruno. The more they hate each other, the
more famous they become. As the power dynamics
shift between them, Julian helps them navigate the
political and social landscape of each decade. He
makes sure they stay together, despite the cruelties
they subject each other to.
With Dying of Laughter, festival regular Alex de la
Iglesia (Accion Mutante, El Dia de la Bestia, Perdita
Durango) combines an uncanny knack for dark
subject matter with a unique sense of humour to
create a hilarious black comedy. With painstaking
attention to detail, de la Iglesia has recreated the
seventies and eighties. He has furthermore elicited
fantastic performances from his two leads. Spanish
TV’s motormouth El Gran Wyoming as Bruno and
actor-director Santiago Segura (El Dia de la Bestia,
Torrente : The Dumb Arm Of The Law) as Nino seem
perfectly at ease with the frenetic demands of slapstick

But Alice, who lives below her, is far from

The Debt Collector, a dark contemporary Scottish

Heaven is the second feature of Scott Reynolds, the

Heaven combines an intelligent storyline with fine
acting, plenty of pace and imaginative time-shifting
and cross-cutting. Gradually you’ll get pulled deeper
and deeper into the story, never knowing when
the next revelation will hit you. Martin Donovan
(Trust, The Portrait of a Lady, The Opposite of Sex) is
excellent as Robert Marling. Joanna Going (Wyatt

Young director Michael Hurst has already made
some 50 short films and an ultra-low budget horror

No Deposit, No Return by director Massimo Costa

He partners Frankie with Iggy, a burnt-out roadie, to

the monster tries to assert itself. A schizo relationship
starts to develop between the monster and his

Brian O’Hara’s Rock ‘N Roll Frankenstein boldly goes
where bad taste has rarely gone before. Brian
learned the tricks of the trade by editing porn movies
and worked his way up to low budget exploitation
flicks. Frustrated and disappointed with the
trials and tribulations of his first film, he made a
desperate move by adapting his most extreme
script to the screen. The result is a frontal assault on
the politically correct powers that be. Homosexuality,
Catholicism, bestiality and necrophilia are used
in such perverse ways that the tolerance level of its
viewers is tested to the limits. With campy and outrageous
acting and effects, Rock ‘N Roll Frankenstein
is no-holds barred silly entertainment that
should be seen at one’s own risk."

A few months later, when the yoke of Mr. Jones has become intolerable, two pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, lead the animals in a revolt that chases Mr. Jones and his wife of the farm. The animals are now in charge. Snowball changes the sign on the gate to read “Animal Farm” and paints the commandments of “animalism” on the side of the barn.

Animal Farm is a thrilling live action animation adaptation of George Orwell’s famous allegory on the nature of dictatorships.

who subsequently subjects her to a series of experiments.
The results are amazing. Lola has now
become the most beautiful girl in the world. Eleven
years later. The police discover a mutilated corpse of
a senior citizen. It’s the latest in a series of murders
that always take place at night. And everything
points to Lola as the murderer.
The Ugliest Girl in the World is the second long feature
of Spanish director Miguel Bardem, author of
the exciting short La madre (1995) and the long
feature Mas que amor frenesi (1996), realised
together with Alfonso Albacete and David Menkes.
Bardem dips various fantasy myths in a bath of
black humour. His movie consists of two parts. The
first shows a dark image of late 20th century Spain.
In the second we are immersed in a frightening
futuristic universe. La Mujer Mas Fea Del Mundo
offers science-fiction and comedy, Beauty & the
Beast and Jeckyll & Hyde, accompanied by an acidic
view on the superficiality of this fin de sciècle. With
a superb performance by Elia Galera as beautiful
and ugly Lola Otero."

Little Red Riding Hood. The audience consists
of one : birthday boy Nicolas. This grandson of Alex

him from enjoying the play. When night falls,

about a serial killer terrorising the region are unfortunately
dead on the mark.
French cinema is quite often associated with grim
realism or historical costume dramas. But young
Lionel Delplanque has embraced the rarely practised
horror genre to make his first steps as a director.
This slasher à la française, doused with black
humour, often reminds you of the glory days of the
Italian Giallo. At the same time, the actors, among
whom the impressive François Berléand (Romance),
the all too willing Clothilde Courau (Le Petit Criminel,

Classical music and hydraulic presses collide in this
marvellously deranged Bulgarian allegory of a
mechanised, soulless society, where the name Wagner
refers to a machine, not a composer. Director
Andrey Slabakoff describes his debut long feature
as “a parable of an absurd system, a world in which
real dreams are missing”, Wagner sketches a darkly

mankind accross the Earth, forever condemned

The Babel’s task becomes more perilous at each

The escalation of conflicts around the world, the

clear connections with the apocalyptic account of

the screenplay and composed the music for his long

Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s (not related to...) latest film could
best be described as an environmental thriller in

An Eye for an Eye is a Finnish horror film by Atro
Lahtela. Besides trying to scare us, Lahtela has also
stuffed his film with dark and absurd humour. His
main theme is very familiar : the secret past of our
loved ones. It’s very human to try to lock evil secrets
away, but as we know from countless other movies,
it always comes back with a vengeance. An Eye for

the viewer from the tantalising intrigue set up here,
with the usually intractable cityscape of London

It’s a world of mysterious, disquieting corners with
more than a tang of Godard’s vision of Paris in
Alphaville. Following was shot over weekends on

They move into the beautiful loft that Nick
originally bought with Stella, his first wife, who was
killed two years ago. Catherine soon starts to feel as
if she’s intruding in someone else’s space. Her insecurity
and paranoia increase when she begins to
find mysterious lipstick stains on the mirror and
another woman’s hair in her hairbrush. But when
she is attacked by an unseen assailant, she starts to
suspect everyone around her. Beatrice, a successful
art dealer, had more than a passing interest in both
Nick and his previous wife. Charlie, a brilliant mathematician,
is Nick’s best friend. He explores the
possibilities of co-existing time frames; past and
present sharing the same space. Catherine, increasingly
unsure of her own sanity, asks her closest
friend, the depressed and eccentric Daisy, to keep
her company. Then Catherine discovers Stella’s old
diary. It immediately disappears, only to resurface
with new entries... in Stella’s handwriting.
The Intruder is an intriguing story of love, paranoia,
murder & parallel time by internationally renowned
photographer David Bailey. With lots of suspense
and nicely stylised sequences, it makes optimal use
of its talented cast. Charlotte Gainsbourg (The
Cement Garden, Jane Eyre) is an engaging lead as
Catherine. Charles Powell (Screamers, Eye of the
Beholder) plays Nick. Molly Parker (The Five Senses)
delivers a beautiful performance as Daisy. John
Hannah (Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Mummy)
is Charlie and Nastassja Kinski (Paris, Texas, One

Thomas is eager to do well with his clients. But his
inadequacy in measuring people fosters growing
paranoia. Frustrated and paralysed, he awaits the
arrival of his twin sister, Vera, for the annual terror of
the Tailor’s Ball Competition. Thomas is suddenly
challenged to perform his craft under constant and
horrifying glares. Terrorised to no end, his fear spiral
out of control and leads him to murder.
Kill by Inches is a bizarre, almost archaic film set in a
former period of the 20th century, where ordinary
townsfolk had their clothes custom-tailored and
tailoring itself was an honoured craft celebrated at
an annual ball. With a tone of restrained urgency
and underlying menace, this film charts the most
minute traces of psychological and familial disturbance.
Somewhat reminiscent of the work of the
Brothers Quay, Kill by Inches is set in a world that
evokes the dark side of the modern period : the
world of Kafka, Beckett, Caligari and Polanski. The
co-directors of Kill by Inches come by their cinematic
skills through their family heritage as well as film
school training, both being graduates from the New

is the daughter of Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, one of
the founders of Cahiers du Cinéma. And Arthur

With Labyrinth of Dreams, maverick Japanese filmmaker

has made a haunting, dreamlike mystery in blackand-
white. The movie was based on a book by
Kyusaku Yumeno (+ 1936), whose writing embraced
the mystery thriller, fairy tale and fantasy. Ishii handles
this very strange story as though it were some
kind of beautiful nightmare. A very physical director,
he expertly uses image and sound to propel the
viewer into the heart of the mystery. Rena Komine is
disturbingly effective as the naive, foolhardy Tomiko
and Tadanobu Asano evokes a brooding presence
as the ardent lover who may, or may not be an

But memory manipulation is a treacherous business, especially for Kater, who has nothing but memories left.
Austrian director Valentin Hitz’s beautifully bleak Rat Race, a grainy, black-and-white nightmare, is one of the most intriguing pieces of science-fiction noir to appear since Jean-Luc Godard’s Alphaville. Hitz explores the philosophic divide between body and mind while revelling in its more visceral aspects. Can a person without a heart still love ? Is a person without a brain necessarily without memories ? How much can you cut away from people before they stop being who they are ? These are difficult questions and, as Kater learns, you can’t find answers without getting a little blood on your hands."

This famous and notorious film company has fashioned
their long story of success from defying the

movies which Hollywood often neglects. Terror
Firmer is the ultimate realisation of Troma’s antiauthoritarian
aesthetic, mixed with generous quantities
of erotic content and gallons of simulated

They could tell you that the Festival attracts more than 60.000 fans and that it clearly satisfies a need. It has created a strong image with which its audience can clearly indentify.
They could tell you that the Festival will spread its tentacles all over Brussels, starting from the Passage 44 and moving on to Cinema Nova, passing through the Old Ice Cellars of St.Gilles and the Maison Bis-Art-Bizarre, through the Maison du Livre and the Cultural Centre Jacques Franck (for Imaginaire 2000), through the Media Library of the French Community, the Free University of Brussels and finally through the Actor’s Studio for a TroMarathon.
They could also tell you that the Festival will gobble up Antwerp, Ghent, Hasselt, Leuven, Ostend, La Louvière, Namur and Liège, where the 6th Nights of Fantasy Films and the First Marathon of Fantasy Films will take place; without forgetting the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg that will organise the 4th edition of our little brother-festival : Cinénygma.
They could still tell you that the Festival will not only explore the imagination of filmmakers all over the globe, but also that of sculptors, painters, writer, actors, make-up artists, fashion designers, comic-strip artists,...
They could tell you that the Festival has succeeded in composing a program of quality without losing an ounce of its popularity.

“Imaginary Brussels”
Like every year, students from two renowned Brussels film schools will spread out across the streets of the capital. They’re in search of the ultimate shot to visualise the screenplays that originated from their imagination. Once more, the International Festival of Fantasy Films will give students of the Rits and the Narafi about ten days to realise a short film on the subject of “Fantastic Brussels”. After Dick Maas, Freddie Francis, Lewis Gilbert and the duo Stuart Gordon/Dennis Paoli, Dutch director Jos Stelling enthusiastically took up the challenge of assisting the students with the realisation of their projects. He will meet the students twice before the festival, on the 12th and 26th of February, in order to turn their ideas, desires and fantasies into a strong screenplay.
In 1974 Dutch director Jos Stelling (1945°) made his debut with Mariken van Nieumeghen. This adaptation of the well-known Medieval play was selected for Cannes. With his following films, Elckerlyc (1975) and Rembrandt Fecit 1669 (1977), he kept exploring European history.

comparison with Cronenberg, Tsukamoto’s enduring
obsessions, the uncertain relationship between man and
technology and the way in which pain and mutation can
betray the body, has given birth to a bruiser of a filmography:
Tetsuo 1: The Iron Man (1989) and Tetsuo 2: Body Hammer
(1992)- are the last word in cyber-punk experimentation. In
Tokyo Fist (1995) he transforms boxers into bloody fighting
machines, and Bullet Ballet (1998) explores into the
possibility that violence and weapons really do warp the

2000,event,"Retrospective, The Tromarathon",,The Tromarathon,,,,,"Tromarathon at the Actor’s Studio:
25 years of “authentic independent cinema”
in thirteen movies
For 25 years now, a small New York film company courageously battles to let its radical vision on cinema prevail. Film after film, with their cameras as instruments, the Troma team composes a symphony of bad taste, an epic poem in which the finale always degenerates in bloody splattering intestines and various malodorous defecations.
This pugnacity, rare in times of ideological scarcity, deserves a tribute. And that’s why we’ve organised one, together with the movie theatre Actor’s Studio. From midnight Friday 17 March till midnight Saturday 18 March, Tromaphiles from the four corners of the Kingdom will be able to admire these jewels of a quarter century of dubious celluloid passion. And that’s not all, folks ! That same Saturday 18 March, at 24h30 the Troma-fan, with bloodshot eyes and a stiff back, will drag himself to the Auditorium of the Passage 44 to be carried away by the latest Troma opus : “Terror Firmer”.
All of this in the presence of Mister Troma himself, Lloyd Kaufman, accompanied by his favourite Tromette, Debbie Rochon. So brace yourselves for delirious madness and deliciously tasteless surprises like only Troma can come up with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2000,event,Art Exhibition,,LE DERNIER CRI / L’ HÔPITAL BRUT,,,,,"Originating from the most independent
and radical branch of the French comic
strip, the driving forces behind the
international art collective “Le Dernier
Cri” operate from a (silk-screen)printing
office in Marseilles. They have already
published dozens of books, posters,
record sleeves and fanzines, of which
“L’Hôpital Brut” is the crown jewel. This
initiative will be presented to you in all
its manifestations : as an animated
movie (the long version of a broadcast
realised for “L’oeil du cyclone”), in
fanzines (displayed in the foyer of the
Nova)... and at an exhibition (some
twenty luminous boxes filled with
objects used during the making of the
film).
Cinema Nova has asked Stéphane
Blanquet, one of the artists of “L’Hôpital
Brut”, to design the poster for “The
Seventh Orbit” and to present his latest
animated movies, fresh from the
drawing board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2000,event,Art Exhibition,,Eurociné posters,,,,,"During “The Seventh Orbit” homage will be rendered to the production house of the most outrageous
French Z-movies : Eurociné. Besides the projection of some films, a dozen large, classic posters will be exhibited
in the hallway of the movie theatre.
Exhibitions from 17 March till 1 April at Cinema Nova, accessible every day during or in between projections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
