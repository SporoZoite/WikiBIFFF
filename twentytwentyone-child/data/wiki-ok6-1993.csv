Acid rains and nuclear incidents seriously damaged the landscape. But the worst plague that this planet has ever known comes from the constant development of automation: robots are legion, and the survival of the humankind has become a real struggle. Captain John Brennick, former member of the Black Berets and his wife, Karen, broke the law. After the loss of their first child, Karen is pregnant again. The couple tries to cross the border, because they refuse to follow the government’s orders, which want to requisition every newborn, but their attempt failed. During the gunfight that follows, Karen manages to escape, but Brennick is taken prisoner and sent to the Fortress: the most sophisticated prison ever built. This high-tech prison of thirty gigantic floors buried in the ground defies every boundary of the imagination. Prisoners are constantly supervised by computers and discipline is maintained through particularly cruel procedures. When they arrive, Brennick and the other prisoners meet Poe, the Fortress’s supervisor, who clearly warns them of the definitive form of the punishment if they violate the rules, but Brennick remains determined to reunite with Karen…

The director of RE-ANIMATOR, DOLLS, THE PIT & THE PENDULUM and FROM BEYOND – based on H.P. LOVECRAFT’s work – transports us through FORTRESS in a spectacular and futuristic adventure featuring stunning sets. Stuart GORDON, the screenwriter of HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS and its sequel, chose CHRISTOPHE LAMBERT (GREYSTOKE, HIGHLANDER, KNIGHT MOVES and more recently MAX AND JEREMIE, with P. NOIRET and J.P. MARIELLE) to play the role of Brennick. JEFFREY COMBS (THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM, RE-ANIMATOR), the fetish actor of STUART GORDON and invited to the Festival in 1990, shares the screen with LAMBERT, KURTWOOD SMITH and LORYN LOCKLIN."
1993,movie ,Closing ,,ACCIÓN MUTANTE,Álex de la Iglesia,1993,"Spain , France",,,"Antonio Resines, Álex Angulo, Frédérique Feder",,,,,,,90',"Comedy, Fantasy, Science-Fiction",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0106215,?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_24",,,,,"Madrid, in the future. The world is dominated by stylists and golden boys. The terrorist group Accion Mutante fights the system alone and demands the right to ugliness. Ramon, the group’s leader, gets out of jail with an amazing idea: to kidnap Patricia Orujo, the daughter of the King of Fast Food. Accion Mutante decides to strike on her wedding day. The terrorists appear suddenly from the wedding cake, in front of the horrified guests and after bloody gunshots, they take their captive away on their spaceship. The exchange for the ransom must take place in the only bar of the planet Axturias, whose inhabitants are all miners who have not seen a woman for twenty years.
On their way, Ramon betrays and kills his companions from Accion Mutante. While the ship crashes on Axturias, Ramon ends up alone with Patricia, who has, in the meantime, fallen in love with him, because of Stockholm syndrome. However, their tranquility will quickly end: Orujo is furious and determined to get his daughter back.

For his first feature, Alex de la IGLESIA benefited from the support of a renowned producer: Pedro ALMODOVAR (HIGH HEELS, MATADOR, WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN…), whose personality leaves a visible mark in the film. He describes ACCION MUTANTE as «a gore parody, between HARDWARE and DELICATESSEN"". Besides, the ""cocktail"" of special effects is a creation of the French team of this last film. For the rest: apocalyptic settings, satirical and highly corrosive scenario and tone, and everything is surrounded by violence and a highly pleasing bad taste. For this production, the ALMODOVAR brothers, both producers, associated with Ciby 2000, Francis Bouygues’s company. As a result, the film received a budget particularly significant (for a first feature), as well as exceptional special effects."
1993,movie ,International Competition,,ARMY OF DARKNESS,Sam Raimi,1992,USA,,International Competition,"Bruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz, Marcus Gilbert",,,,,,,81',"Comedy, Horror ",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0106308,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0",,,,,"Ash, the moron with a chainsaw replacing his right hand, has just been sent back to the medieval era because of a spell that went wrong. Knights in armor take him prisoner and bring him to King Arthur’s castle. Once there, Ash must fight a hairy and disgusting monster, which is nevertheless an expert in martial arts. After defeating it, Ash is freed. However, in order to go back to his time, he must find the Necronomicon, a grimoire made of human skin that resurrects the dead. His chainsaw is replaced by a wonderful mechanical hand, and Merlin the magician teaches him a magic formula that will protect him from the army of darkness. After a journey full of unexpected turns of events, Ash reaches the cemetery where the cursed book should be. He manages to tear it from the pedestal it lies on, but forgets to recite the formula Merlin taught him earlier. While Ash claims victory, the dead rise from their graves and get ready to attack Arthur’s fortress…!

For this third part of the EVIL DEAD’s saga, Sam RAIMI chose to distance himself from gore: ARMY OF DARKNESS has much more in common with THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD than with the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Comedy is also omnipresent, and the action scenes come after one another at the speed of a good old TEX AVERY. In fact, the dynamism of Ash, interpreted by Bruce CAMPBELL (EVIL DEAD, EVIL DEAD II) contributes a lot to it: he is constantly moving, gets his ass kicked through the whole film and smashes an incredible number of skeletons, zombies, and other demons. EVIL DEAD III is also (and above all) a genuine festival of special effects: apart from TERMINATOR 2, no other film contains so many special effects."
1993,movie ,International Competition,,AS IN HEAVEN,Kristín Jóhannesdóttir,1992,Iceland,,International Competition,"Álfrún Örnólfsdóttir, Tinna Gunnlaugsdóttir, Helgi Skúlason",,,,,,,122',"Drama, History ",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0105504,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0",SVO A JÖRDU SEM A HIMNI,,,,"The story begins on the west coast of Iceland, at the end of summer 1936. A little girl named Hrefna, walks on the beach. Her family lives in a dilapidated farm and survives somehow, especially because, according to Hrefna’s grandmother, the farm and the surrounding area are cursed by a malediction from the 14th century!
This thought appeals to the fertile imagination of the young girl, who then begins to oscillate between present and past. One day, a ship of the French navy, the “Pourquoi Pas?”, grounds just in front of the farm: for Hrefna, this is a direct consequence of the malediction. Using the whole imaginative power of childhood, she goes back with her family to the 14th century, determined to change the course of destiny.

Kristin JOHANNESDOTTIR is nowadays one of the most talented and original directors from Iceland. She studied filmmaking for a long time in France before coming back to her homeland, where she started her own production company. AS IN HEAVEN, directed and written by her, is to date her second feature after RAINBOW'S END in 1983. Her film makes us feel tragedies and passions through the eyes of a little girl. It shows us how the inventive mind of Hrefna uses the events she goes through to overcome her deepest terrors."
1993,movie ,International Competition,,BRAINDEAD,Peter Jackson,1992,New Zealand,,International Competition,"Timothy Balme, Diana Peñalver, Elizabeth Moody",,,,,,,104',"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0103873,?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_20",,,,,"In the lost jungle of Sumatra, a zoologist captures a strange animal, a hybrid creature between a monkey and a rat. This sacrilegious act focuses the fury of an indigenous tribe on him. A wild pursuit then begins and ends tragically for our reckless explorer. Meanwhile, in a small town in New Zealand, the poor Lionel struggles with his old mother, who is so possessive that he has to arrange secret dates with the beautiful Paquita. One evening, during one of these clandestine dates, the two lovers meet at the zoo. While spying on them, Lionel’s mother is bitten by the demonic monkey-rat that happened to be wandering there. Lionel takes her home. Her wounds explode, covering the wall with a purulent liquid. The old lady quickly turns into a zombie and develops an excessive desire for human flesh. Anyone who approaches her will pay the price, starting with her nurse and the priest who came to administer the Anointing of the Sick.

After BAD TASTE and MEET THE FEEBLES, the New Zealander king of gore, Peter Jackson, is back with BRAINDEAD. As expected, hemoglobin and bad taste are more than present. Blood, pus, puke and other liquids squirt everywhere, thanks to the work of Richard Taylor, the special effects director. As always with Jackson, second degree parody and clichés are not lacking: starting from the parody of INDIANA JONES to an ending worthy of an ancient tragedy. But BRAINDEAD is not only a masterpiece of the splatter genre: it also offers a very funny, if not caustic, view of the contemporary New Zealand society. The film won the Grand Prix at the Avoriaz and Porto Festivals in 1993."
1993,movie ,International Competition,,A CHINESE GHOST STORY 3,Tung Ch siu,1992,Hong Kong,,International Competition,"Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Joey Wang, Jacky Cheung",,,,,,,104',"Action, Comedy, Fantasy",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0102932,?ref_=nm_flmg_stn_36",SIEN LUI YAU WAN III: DOU DOU DOU,,,,"In the heart of the forests of China stands the solitary Orchid Temple, which has been a cursed place for generations. Only a few travelers, careless or lost, seek shelter there, but disappear forever. A venerable master and his disciple named Fang, a shy and clumsy young man, are on their way to the imperial palace to bring a solid gold statue of Buddha. As they are chased by mobsters, their only way out is to hide in the Temple. An enviable but also risky decision for those who know the fate reserved to whoever is caught by the claws of Lotus (Hsu-Hsien WANG) and Jade, two splendid ghost women serving Lau-Lau (Siu-Ming LAU), the Tree Devil and master of the Temple, and bringing him his daily human flesh ration! The next mission of Lotus and Jade will consist of seducing the two monks who took refuge in the sanctuary...

Siu-Tung CHING directed the first A CHINESE GHOST STORY in 1987, a success greeted by the Special Prize of the Jury at the Avoriaz and Paris Festivals in 1988. He waited until 1990 to come back with the sequel, presented during a preview showing at the Festival in 1991, and win the Prize for Special Effect the next year at Avoriaz. A CHINESE GHOST STORY III, three in a row for CHING: after a first film putting romanticism in the spotlight and a second one filled with rage, noises and astonishing special effects, he comes up, with the help of his scriptwriter and producer Tsui HARK, with a third part that seems more delicate, slower, and naughtier than the previous films. For that, all you need to do is stick to the basic recipe, which consists of a romance between the hero and a beautiful ghost, a Buddhist, some aerial combats, and a real villain ready for anything to get what he wants. You add some new features, such as a hint of erotism and oriental mysticism and a very esoteric ending. If you have the talent of CHING, you will get A CHINESE GHOST STORY III."
1993,movie ,International Competition,,DOPPELGANGER by Avi Nesher,Avi Nesher,1993,USA,,International Competition,"Drew Barrymore, George Newbern, Dennis Christopher",,,,,,,104',"Horror, Romance, Thriller ",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0106753,?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_14",,,,,"When Patrick Highsmith, a young writer at the beginning of his career, agrees to rent a room of his apartment to Holly Gooding, he is immediately attracted by the stunning beauty of this young woman. However, he also feels that something is wrong with her. Holly’s temperament is actually unstable and unpredictable: the pretty girl can be shy and innocent at one time and the second after aggressive and provocative. One night, Patrick and Holly make love, but the morning after, she swears that she is not the one who slept with him… Holly is convinced that she is stalked by a doppelganger, a creature that is her perfect copy. The only desire of this maleficent entity is to kill Holly in order to take her place. Patrick, astonished, finds it hard to believe her story; is Holly crazy? Is she really pursued by such a demon ? Torn between what his reason and his heart are telling him, the young man will have to make a choice…

Directed by Avi NESHER (TIME BOMB, RAGE AND GLORY), DOPPELGANGER could be compared to a female version of DR. JEKYLL AND MISTER HYDE. The doppelganger is much more ""a spirit monster"" than a personified demon: it represents the dark side of the human being, the personification of our pernicious passions. If we are not careful enough, it can destroy us and spirit our place away. It is therefore a very old theme of which Avi NESHER proposes a modern interpretation, represented by excellent actors, in particular Drew BARRYMORE (GUN CRAZY, POISON IVY) playing Holly Gooding and George NEWBERN (FATHER OF THE BRIDE) interpreting the writer Patrick Highsmith."
1993,movie ,"International Competition, The Night, 11th Fantastic Night",,DR. GIGGLES,Manny Coto,1992,USA,,International Competition,"Larry Drake, Holly Marie Combs, Cliff De Young",,,,,,,95',"Comedy, Drama, Horror",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0104139,?ref_=nm_knf_t2",,,,,"Evan Rendell, from the small town of Moorehigh, has always dreamt of being a doctor like his esteemed father, but when this respectable practitioner finds out that his beloved wife suffers from an incurable heart disease, he falls completely into madness. To save her, Evan’s father does not hesitate to carry out daring attempts of transplants from living donors, who, of course, did not consent. When the inhabitants of Moorehigh find out what is going on, they dispense justice themselves and lynch him. Evan, who is eight years old, escapes them by hiding in the eviscerated body of his mother and disappears into the wild. As he too falls into madness, he ends up in a psychiatric hospital where his obsession with medicine and his strange giggle make him known as Dr. Giggles. He manages to escape from the hospital and goes back to his hometown, craving for revenge and disguised as… a doctor.

Directed by Manny Coto, Dr. GIGGLES, which received the Special Jury Award at Avoriaz, is a horror film peppered with black humor and impressive gory scenes (such as the one where Evan clears his path with a scalpel through the abdomen of his deceased mother) thanks to the talent of the K.N.B. team. This mad doctor is remarkably interpreted by Larry Drake (the bad guy in DARKMAN by Sam Raimi), chosen for his imposing stature, ability to inspire trust, and to transform in the blink of an eye into a terrifying and cruel character. As for the young and pretty Campbell, subject of the Machiavellian experiments, she is played by Holly Marie Combs, and it is Glenn Quinn who interprets marvelously the fiancé of our young heroine, another victim of the terrible Dr.Giggles. The music is masterfully composed by the unmatched Brian May (guitarist of Queen), who is already the author of numerous films soundtracks such as those for MAD MAX, FREDDY'S DEAD, THE DAY AFTER, HALLOWEEN..."
1993,movie ,International Competition,,DUST DEVIL,Richard Stanley,1992,UK,,International Competition,"Robert John Burke, Chelsea Field, Zakes Mokae",,,,,,,87',"Horror, Mystery, Thriller ",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0104155,?ref_=nm_knf_t4",,,,,"In the Namib Desert, burning under the sun’s rays, a hellish breeze is blowing. A man is walking, and his dark silhouette rises on the horizon. He is wearing a black hat, worn-out boots, and his long, tattered coat floats like the wings of the devil. No one knows who he is or where he comes from. He has been wandering for so long and embodying so many characters that he has himself forgot his identity. He is a magician, a soldier, and a saint at the same time, but he is above all a merciless killer, bringing death wherever he goes. He seems to be driven by the desert’s wind and an unstoppable force. His destination: Bethany, a town where voodoo myth and reality merge, a man collects the souls of his victims through the lens of his Polaroid and different fates will meet, oppose each other and join the same fight. In this devilish and bloody hell, constantly swept by sandstorms, only the love of a woman can save his lost soul.

Second film by the South African director and now living in Great Britain, Richard STANLEY, brilliant author of HARDWARE (a stylized cyberpunk film). DUST DEVIL follows the same path with stunning images of the hero walking in the desert, paced with the violent and gliding music of Simon Boswell. Garnished with ancient mythologies, a hint of western and exceptional gory effects, this film is a fantasy on the big screen, a bloody road movie on a fantastic background, and an aesthetic descent into hell. This combination of genres goes right to Stanley and makes him a master of the horror, with a strong and very personal visual style, that you will not forget anytime soon."
1993,movie ,International Competition,,DARK AT NOON,Raoul Ruiz,1992,"France , Portugal , Spain",,International Competition,"John Hurt, Didier Bourdon, Lorraine Evanoff",,,,,,,100',"Comedy, Fantasy",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0105045,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0",L'OEIL QUI MENT,,,,"The story takes place a few years after the Phoney War. Felicien, a young Parisian doctor and expert in miraculous healings and other unexplainable phenomena, discovers by accident that his late father invested the family fortune in a small remote village in Portugal. Tired of his medical duties and intrigued by this mystery, he decides to go to the village and learn more about it. But curiosity is a bad thing and Felicien will soon start to know why. As soon as he arrives, he witnesses mind-blowing phenomena: the Blessed Virgin appears multiple times and miscellaneous objects fall from the sky on the village. However, the villagers do not seem to be concerned by all of this. What could be more normal, in fact, for those people living at night and sleeping the day, and whose dogs – to which they devote a real cult – feed on corpses? Felicien, still shaken, meets Anthony, one of his father’s friends and engaged to Ines, a beautiful young woman.

Raoul RUIZ is an unusual director. Since his debut as a filmmaker (THREE SAD TIGERS) in 1968, he has never stopped filming. For his last film, the director called on professional actors. John HURT (ALIEN, 1984, HEAVEN'S GATE and the unforgettable ELEPHANT MAN) plays the double role of Anthony and Le Marquis. The casting, let’s be clear, is like RUIZ’s films: surprising. Didier BOURDON (from LES INCONNUS) obtained the role of the meticulous doctor and Daniel PREVOST (LAISSE ALLER… C'EST UNE VALSE, I DON’T KNOW MUCH, BUT I’LL SAY EVERYTHING) perfectly plays the role of the bored priest. The beautiful Ines is interpreted by Lorraine VANOFF (UN PÈRE ET PASSE, THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VÉRONIQUE). DARK AT NOON was in competition at CANNES and CHICAGO. The film also won the awards for Best Music and Best Photography at the International Fantastic Film Festival of SITGES in 1992."
1993,movie ,International Competition,,MATINEE,Joe Dante,1993,USA,,International Competition,"John Goodman, Cathy Moriarty, Simon Fenton, Robert Picardo",,,,,,,99',"Comedy, Drama ",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0107529,?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_24",,,,,"In Florida during the 1960s, Gene, a 14-year-old boy, lives happily with his family and friends. These teenagers will be confronted with two events that will make them move from childhood to adulthood. The famous horror film producer, Lawrence Woolsey, arrives in town for the preview of his new feature: MANT (a tribute by J. DANTE to the cult film THE DEADLY MANTIS by Nathan Juran). The fact that they discover fear and fantastic on Saturday morning screenings could be completely ordinary. However, it takes place during the Cuban missile crisis, which causes the psychological troubles that we imagine, reaches unexpected dimensions, and hits the headlines of every media. For Gene and his loved ones, from now on, nothing will ever be the same again…

For his new film, Joe DANTE (GREMLINS, INNERSPACE) gathered only talented people: Charlie HAAS (GREMLINS 2), Jerico STONE (MY STEPMOTHER IS AN ALIEN) and Ed NAHA (HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS). This dark humor, diabolically orchestrated by John GOODMAN (ALWAYS, BARTON FINK, SEA OF LOVE), has the particularity to rely on a mise en abyme (a film into a film) that leads the spectator into a universe of illusions, where the (fake) reality of the cinema confronts the (true) reality of major stories such as the radio adaptation of “The War of the Worlds” by Orson WELLES. MATINEE is the perfect opportunity to rediscover John AGAR (REVENGE OF THE CREATURE), Robert CORNTHWAITE (THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD), William SCHALLERT (THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN) and other actors from the good old 1950s sci-fi films, to which DANTE pays tribute in a thrilling way during several scenes shot in black and white."

The Earth is nothing but an open wound where violence is at its peak. Chaos and crime prevail. From this turmoil a new generation emerged: the cyborgs, synthetic entities that threaten to take over the power by their superiority over human beings… Alex Rain is an elite cop from the L.A.P.D. (Los Angeles Police Department), but he is not like the others, he is a superior being, a human “enhanced” thanks to the new cybernetic technologies. After a mission that went (very) bad, he finds refuge in Mexico City in order to vanish for a while. But he realizes soon that there is a price on his head because the government decided to get rid of him. He then discovers that an extremely confidential program in a computer chip was activated and aims at replacing the heads of states by “replicants”. Alex must find and destroy it at all costs. A wild race then begins, on which depends the survival of the human race.

The Hawaiian Albert PYUN (THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER, CYBORG, DANGEROUSLY CLOSE, …), who was a former student of the master KUROSAWA, leads us this time in a heavily qualitative and futuristic adventure, frightening and mind-blowing. The unusual universe of NEMESIS is a subtle mix of the works of John WOO (THE KILLER, HARD BOILED), James CAMERON (TERMINATOR) and the glorious film by Richard STANLEY, HARDWARE. In addition to a delirious and sordid setting, NEMESIS is a well-paced film where the action is almost permanent and transports the spectator in the middle of a world, which fate depends on a single man in the grip of the final countdown. For the role of Alex Rain, PYUN chose the French Olivier Gruner. This expert in kickboxing made his debut - and proved his talent - in ANGEL TOWN."

But as soon as she arrives in her new house, she realizes that she forgot her anti-cellulite cream at Zardo’s house. Since this cream cannot be purchased anywhere in town, she urges that Sergio brings in back. Reluctant at first, he eventually accepts. Sergio visits Zardo but finds the corpse of the latter lying in his blood with his throat slit. Someone rings at the door. The neighbors, concerned by strange noises, called the police. Sergio pretends to be Zardo. After a quick inspection, the officers leave the place, reassured. Sergio then decides to leave the town in order to get rid of this bulky package, but he is bothered in his efforts by a farmer too curious and his big black dog. When he comes back to his car, he discovers that the corpse disappeared! He comes back home, but Francesca is not there. Instead, Sergio faces a strange man, to whom he says that he is Zardo. The man, called Ambrosio, is actually a private detective hired by the mother of (the real) Zardo. As having broken into Sergio’s house does not seem to satisfy the detective, he blackmails him by offering to trade the corpse in exchange for a large amount of money.

The story of this dark comedy is inspired, with a hint of irony and horror, by the theme of the ""diabolical lovers"" and is the work of an Italian not very well known here. Nevertheless, GIANCARLO SOLDI has been shooting films for more than ten years and – it is true – mainly for the television. Zardo is remarkably played by SERGIO CASTELLITO, one of the rising stars of the Italian cinema and whose career is already very impressive (MAGIC MOMENTS with Stefania Sandrelli, THE BIG BLUE, THE FLESH, ALBERTO EXPRESS). Francesca, the undecided woman with an androgynous look, is interpreted by CHIARA
CASELLI (L'ANNÉE DE L'ÉVEIL, SENSO, MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO), who seems to enjoy this ambiguous role. A curiously sensual ballet..."

Although the clues accumulate, indicating that she and Henry are heading toward a dreadful destiny, Henry stubbornly refuses to see things objectively.

Alexander CASSINI’s first film is an expedition into a world where reality is defined and determined by the media. This is a topic that he knows particularly well, and which fictional approach does not take away the accuracy of the topic. The director wrote the screenplay and also produced STAR TIME.

Sometimes brilliant (OUTLAND, 2010), sometimes more conformist (PRESIDIO, RUNNING SCARED), Peter HYAMS challenges himself with STAY TUNED, a biting satire of television and the evil consequences of its massive consumption. This is indeed the first experience of the director in this genre (he was also in charge of the photography). Everything, from the commercials to the media hype, including the abundance of US channels, has been put through the mill in a complete madness of hilarious images and funny situations. And let’s not forget the incorporation of cartoons, drawn by Chuck JONES, BUGS BUNNY’s father. Following the success of SOAPDISH and, among others, ACCIDENTAL HERO, STAY TUNED is worth watching.

He is a regular visitor of a library in which he tirelessly consults the oldest books, and he spends his days lying on a bed in an abandoned building. Alex is a lonesome and melancholic vampire: killing humans provides him no pleasure and it is only when he is starving that he does it: he wanders in the ghostly mist of London, looking for prey. When he finds one, the slaughter is horrific: as he does not have pointy canines, he squeezes his victim like an orange and the blood pours in his mouth and on his face, giving him the appearance of a wild beast. Yet, Alex is not insensitive: he aspires to the love of Virginia, the new employee of the library he frequently visits. Virginia is the reincarnation of his deceased mistress he has been seeking for centuries.

Curiously, it is a Japanese woman, Shimako SATO, who wrote and directed this vampire story taking place in London. She found inspiration in the stories of Edgar Allan POE, particularly in the short story ANNABEL LEE. The misty and desperate atmosphere of Poe’s tales is clearly present in this film. Realized with a very small budget, TALE OF A VAMPIRE opts for austerity by avoiding the usual vampiric folklore (coffin, wooden stake, crucifix…). The absence of special effects is mitigated by a repressed poetry and a dark and romantic atmosphere. Shimako SATO shoots with complete finesse, a languid rhythm, and subtle angles of shooting. In order to express this feeling of fatality and repeated tragedy, the director needed an exceptional actor: she found Julian SANDS (GOTHIC), outstanding in the role of Alex.

This Taiwanese film by CHIU KANG-CHIEN, whose scenario is openly adapted from RASHOMON by A. KUROSAWA, narrates the different interpretation of a murder by those who witnessed it. The fantastic is present through resurrected spirits from the afterlife.

She tells him that she is diabetic, and her name is Cheryl. Surrounded by bystanders, Josh takes care of her while a siren rings in the distance and approaches rapidly. An ambulance stops on the sidewalk, two stretcher-bearers with sinister faces get out of it, place Cheryl on a stretcher and say they bring her to St-Francis Hospital. That day in the afternoon, Josh, who is a comic book artist, leaves his job earlier to visit the young woman, but no one with the name of Cheryl or her description has been admitted to the hospital.

The film was directed by Larry Cohen, the undisputed master of the thriller (BLACK CAESAR or HELL UP IN HARLEM) and fantastic genres (IT’S ALIVE or GOD TOLD ME TO, which made him twice winner of the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival as well as the winner of the Main Price of the Paris International Fantastic Film Festival). Just like his previous films, Larry Cohen wrote the scenario. He thought of AMBULANCE after eating spoiled fish in a restaurant, which caused him to be admitted at the hospital. “I intended to make a film about poisonous fishes, but the ambulance seemed more frightening to me.” Josh is brilliantly interpreted by Eric Roberts (RAGGEDY MAN, STAR 80, RUNAWAY TRAIN), and James Earl Jones (Darth Vader in STAR WARS and the Sergeant Major in GARDENS OF STONE) plays the lieutenant Spencer.

After SHORT CIRCUIT (remember Johnny 5, the wandering robot), AND YOU THOUGHT YOUR PARENTS WERE WEIRD! is Hollywood’s response to the growing demand for mass appeal comedies.

Since its creation 10 years ago, THE BEASTMASTER has become a cult film and one of the biggest successes of heroic fantasy, as well as CONAN THE BARBARIAN. BEASTMASTER II, directed by Sylvio TABET, producer of the first film, is already promised to a similar success. However, the general tone is significantly different. It is approached in a less dramatic way, leaving a wider space to comedy and fantastic. The success of the first film made it impossible to change Dar’s appearance: he is therefore still played by the impressive Marc SINGER, the hero of the TV series “V”. His enemy brother Arklon is played by the outstanding Wings HAUSER (UNCOMMON VALOR) and the witch Lyranna is interpreted by Sarah DOUGLAS (SUPERMAN I, II and THE RETURN OF THE SWAMP THING)."

He is accompanied by his son Dany, child of a failed marriage, who blames John for abandoning him all these years. Garrett and Dany settle in a hostel run by Angelina, who, like most of the inhabitants of the neighboring village did, sheltered one of the young orphans, victim of this tragedy. Dany’s uneasiness towards his father is noticed by Micah, the teenager hosted by Angelina, who takes advantage of the situation and leads him to a secret meeting of the Cult of the Corn, of which he has become the new leader. Meanwhile, Garrett meets Frank Red Bear, an Indian anthropologist also trying to solve the mystery surrounding this ghost town. Together, they quickly discover the despicable plan of Hemingford’s officials: to sell the corn harvest from the previous year, contaminated by a dangerous toxin, to heedless buyers.

Although Fritz KIERSCH directed the first film of this macabre story coming from a collection of short stories by Stephen KING (""DANSE MACABRE""), it is David F. PRICE who is in charge of the logical sequel of this bloody harvest. His first steps behind the camera for the sequel of TO DIE FOR, better put together than the first film, were unanimously acclaimed by the critics. The scenario of CHILDREN OF THE CORN II was cheerfully written by regulars of the series TALES FROM THE CRYPT, and the numerous special effects are the result of Bob Keen (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, NIGHTBREED, HARDWARE, BRAINDEAD, ...). The main role of this danse macabre is played by Terence KNOX (ST. ELSEWHERE, THE HITCHHIKER) and the young Ryan BOLLMAN makes his (frightening) screen debut here."

For Isabella, it is the sacred harmony she built around her way of life that broke. As she cannot bear this situation, she throws herself out of the window and dies. But her love for Albert is stronger than death: Isabella comes back to life as a little girl named Anna. She finds Albert, who raises her as his own child. Their passion is still as strong as before, but in the meantime, history has followed its course: in Greece, Jews are now persecuted and Albert’s family is threatened; Anna refuses to share her love, no matter what it costs…

At the limits of fantastic and horror, CRYSTAL NIGHTS is above all a reflection about love in its most destructive forms. Because of its rich content, it is not an easy film: driven by her passion for Heraclitus’s philosophy, the director, Tonia MARKETAKİ, integrates numerous symbols and philosophical references in it.
Based on the Unity of opposites, the film follows the tortuous train of a burning brain. Thanks to the excellent interpretations of the Belgian actor François DELAIVE (MEETING VENUS, A FEW DAYS WITH ME), Michelle VALLEY and Tania TRIPI, CRYSTAL NIGHTS was in official selection at the Cannes Festival in 1992 and won the Olive

A young woman named Lucielle will make him see that life is worth living again, but he discovers that she is involved in a conspiracy and that, thanks to her, the Army hopes that Enak will cooperate. Deeply disappointed, he strangely agrees the proposal. 

Directed by Slawomir IDZIAK, KIESLOWSKI’s assistant for the film THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE, ENAK combines genres with happiness : the film, structured like an investigation, alternates between fiction and real documents and while remaining in the fantastic, it is also and obviously a love story against the backdrop of political spying. Although the film takes place in the 1950s, it promotes existentialist ideas that constitute a reflection on our era. ENAK offers wonderful pictures as well as talented and convincing actors, even though it was shot with few assets and practically no special effects. It is a clever film with a neat aesthetic that also allows us to rediscover the beautiful Irène JACOB (THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE)."

Freddy Ace is an elegant gangster full of self-confidence, so the exact opposite of Henry.

In Alan RUDOLPH’s films (MADE IN HEAVEN, LOVE AT LARGE, MORTAL THOUGHTS), characters evolve on intertwined trajectories, and meet each other at some point before taking different paths. EQUINOX also follows this pattern privileged by the director, showing that he has lost nothing of his talent, quite the contrary. When it comes to captivating or mystifying the spectator, Alan RUDOLPH is in control of the situation. Besides, this brilliant director values his talent as a storyteller to perfection through his skillful ability to create visual moments. The twin brothers with opposing fates are played by Matthew MODINE, who succeeds in the double achievement of making his two characters look similar and radically antagonistic at the same time.

The novel by Mary SHELLEY, written when she was only 19 years ol, has already been adapted multiple times for the cinema, but it is rare to see such a faithful adaptation. The screenwriter and director David WICKES turns the trend around by portraying the REAL Frankenstein’s monster: an innocent creature looking for his humanity.

Audrey Lewis made the first African-American fantastic film and transports us right back into the spirit and form of the American B-series films. She refuses indeed to rely on spectacular special effects, preferring to use them with subtility to punctuate the few fight scenes against these omnipresent, but almost invisible evil beings. The director relies on genre films to express the black identity and its concerns. This is particularly important as it allows us to pinpoint some aspects of the African-American culture and its main commitments. It is clear that the everlasting duality between Good and Evil, that is offered to us in this film, is simply a metaphor of the constant opposition between black and white people in the USA, which has underscored the identity crisis and the reconsideration of the entire black community over the last few years."

Shortly after, a young henchman named Tony kills a man in a library. Yuen investigates the crime and discovers that the victim was an expert in weapons, suspected of smuggling and terrorism. Tony is actually an undercover cop who infiltrated gangs. Yuen disapproves his methods, but both will have to cooperate.                                 

Chow YUN-FAT (HONG KONG 1941, A BETTER TOMORROW, THE KILLER, ONCE A THIEF, NOW YOU SEE LOVE, NOW YOU DON'T), barely known in the West, has become a superstar in whole Asia: as he excels in the roles of villains, he won several awards in the Far East for his interpretations. In this film, he plays for the first time an honest police officer who fights for justice. HARD BOILED, written, and directed by John WOO (who works with Chow YUN-FAT for the fifth time), is a dark and extremely violent film, representative of the trend promoting the liberation and transgression of taboos and morality within the Asian culture and art."

Monroe (Kevin Bernhart), a young and rich owner of nightclubs in an American city, purchases an artwork: a monolith that turns out to be very strange. This new owner allows in fact Pinhead (Doug Bradley) to come back on Earth and fulfill his evil plans. To do so, he uses the transmuted flesh of his victims to raise an army of Cenobites in order to find the Lament Configuration that could send him back to Hell. In the meantime, Terry Farrell (Joey Summerskill), a young and attractive TV presenter is in the grip of real and unbearable nightmares, during which her father, who died in Vietnam before her birth, appears in front of her. What haunts her during the night will remain a mystery until… Do not expect us to tell you more about it!

""Our intention was to realize a film that is not bloody or gross, but simply frightening and intense"", explains Anthony Hickox about his own film. The first experience of partnership between this young filmmaker (author of Waxwork II) and Bob Keen (in charge of the special effects) turns out to be successful with this third part of the HELLRAISER franchise. The third film about the dreaded adventures of Pinhead and his Cenobites has no cause to be envious of the previous ones. HELL ON EARTH offers the purest horror, not necessarily humorous, with a tendency to sadomasochism beloved by Clive Barker, who contributed to the first two films. Atkins, composer, singer, and actor at the same time, made his debut as a screenwriter in 1988 for the second chapter called HELLRAISER: HELLBOUND, and participated again in the realization of this one. He says that « the HELLRAISER series, and Pinhead himself, provide to the world a show of such intensity never seen before. People are fascinated by the puzzles, the doors, and I think that everything connected to the myth of HELLRAISER is about puzzles and doors, making a step in it and entering something beyond everything.”"

To preserve her conscience, she only drinks criminals’ blood. While chasing Sal Macelli, a Mafia’s godfather, she meets Joe Gennaro, an undercover cop in Sal’s gang. Like Marie, Joe is lonely, has no friends, and understands the concerns of the young woman. Both decide to work together in order to put an end to the thug’s gloomy career. However, Sal Macelli is so evil and greedy that he also becomes a vampire. Unlike Mary, the new life of Sal does not bother him, he actually adapts perfectly to it, and his taste for crime transforms him into a vicious and destructive demon. Marie and Joe understand that they must do something fast and efficient if they want to prevent Pittsburgh from becoming the Transylvania of the 21st century.

Like in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, John LANDIS mixes several genres: INNOCENT BLOOD is a love and horror story with a corrosive humor, but it is also an excellent thriller. As always with John LANDIS, references are not lacking, and we therefore discover scenes from famous horror films such as HORROR OF DRACULA and MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE. We also notice the presence of several well-known directors among the walk-on parts, such as Sam RAIMI, Tom SAVINI, Dario ARGENTO and even Alfred HITCHCOCK. Moreover, John LANDIS did not hesitate to call on highly talented actors: Anne PARILLAUD, who won a César for NIKITA, plays a beautiful and moving hemoglobin drinker. The devilish mafioso, Sal Macelli, is interpreted by Robert LOGGIA (JAGGED EDGE, PRIZZI'S HONOR, BIG, SCARFACE, AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN) and Anthony LA PAGLIA (WHISPERS IN THE DARK) plays in this film the best role he ever interpreted, the police officer Joe GENNARO.

However, it turns out that he is a disciple of Lucifer and that he is highly interested in the young woman, who falls in the throes of passion, because of her daily loneliness. But Julia devotes herself to a fantastic passion, in a place where physical beings consult alter egos, imaginary projections or ghosts with troubling behavior. A frightening journey through the catacombs of the desolate city begins for Luisa and her new lover.

WALTER DOEHNER PECANINS directed this ambiguous film, where reality constantly flirts with dreams. The Mexican cinema lived its golden age until the beginning of the 1960s and was mainly specialized in horror B-movies. This cinematography was highly popular, but its success was limited to the Hispanic audience. Directed in 1992, INTIMO TERROR (the original name of SECRET FEAR) competes with international productions and will completely captivate your attention with its subtlety and precision of staging. The city’s ruins speak for themselves and JUAN CARLOS MARTIN, the director of photography, perfectly managed to immortalize this silent message. This anthology of fear and pretense, adapted from a novel by ARMANDO CUSPINEDA, is interpreted by OFELIA MEDINA, ARTURO BERISTAIN and GUILLERMO ZARUR. "

After that he leaves his homeland and settles to the USA. Unfortunately, the enraged leprechaun, finds the thief, and tortures him viciously before taking his life. However, he cannot enjoy the fact to be reunited with its golden treasure: the fate trapped him in a container sealed with a four-leaf clover, which magical power is the only thing capable of countering the elf’s powers. Several years later, the dilapidated ranch of O'Grady is purchased by a rock star called J. D. Reding, who hires his young neighbor Nathan, and his two friends, Alex and Ozzie, to paint the house. Tory, the daughter of J.D., soon comes to meet them: after having met the handsome Nathan, she decides to stay a bit longer with her father. Everything would be perfect if the fate had not chosen this moment to move the four-leaf clover: the leprechaun, finally free, quickly begins to seek its treasure, expiating his rage on every human that has the misfortune to be on its way.

Directed by Mark JONES, who worked for several famous studios and wrote the script of SUPERMAN V, LEPRECHAUN is a horror and fantastic story taking its inspiration in the Irish folklore, full of fairies and elves. The vengeful leprechaun is played by Warwick DAVIS, the star in the film WILLOW, who interprets here a big role (no pun intended). Mark HOLTON (PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, THE NAKED GUN TEEN WOLF, A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN), JENNIFER ANISTON (FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY-OFF) and Robert GORMAN (DON'T TELL MOM THE BABYSITTER'S DEAD, THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, FUNNY ABOUT LOVE) also perform in this film."

Murders, rapes and corruptions are now part of her daily life, but Dana does not care because it is her job and she works well, sometimes very well. When a criminal is found guilty, justice is served, and when a suspect manages to slip through the cracks, her conscience is continuously tormented... until the next case. As a result, Dana does not shy away from anything to reach her goals, even risking her best friend’s life to gather sufficient evidence in order to sentence a defendant. In addition, she received a very interesting case: a man pretending to be a fashion photographer managed to seduce his victims and take pictures of them in their birthday suit… before they file a complaint. Strangely enough, this case stirs up the curiosity of Dana as much as it disgusts her. How could such a petty crook trick all these women apparently smart enough not to be fooled? Dana goes after him, but she underestimated her opponent and Richard decides to also seduce her.

LOVE CRIMES tells the story of love at first sight between two people living in different universes and that nothing predestined the encounter. SEAN YOUNG (BLADE RUNNER, NO WAY OUT, THE BOOST ...) plays Dana, a young attorney with repressed desires and unable to assume her sexuality. PATRICK BERGIN (SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, PATRIOT GAMES ...) shares the screen with her and unleashes his sexual gluttony – and talent for acting- by pushing his prey to eat out of his hand (and not only his hand). The confrontation between these two manipulators reveals dark corners of their personalities that it would have been better not to discover.

This second film by the Hungarian director, András M. MONORY (INSIDERS), transports us into a sordid universe where characters try to escape from reality, each one having its own way to do it. Between W. WENDERS’ poetic realism and J. JARMUSCH’s thrilling grayness, this very stylish film, nicknamed the BLADE RUNNER from the East Bloc, received the Award for Best Photography (thanks to Gabor SZABO) at the Budapest Festival in 1990.

She was then raised by a foster family, and met their son , a boy of her own age. They became like brother and sister, and even more… Ten years later, Nora and her foster family move to an apartment in an old building. She starts to feel strange and somewhat mysterious sensations: at night, she hears footsteps that abruptly stop in front of her door, and the hands of the old clock suddenly start to turn backwards. Who tries to contact her? What does it want and why her?

In his films, Anders GRÖNROS always deals with themes related to life experiences, and tries here to explore a supernatural phenomenon: the border between life and death. To do so, he relied on a story written by Maria Gripe, author of books for children and teenagers, well known around the world (her works were translated in 28 languages), and multiple times awarded. ""Agnes Cecilia"" was published in 1981 and about 100.000 copies were printed in Sweden alone. THE MYSTERY OF AGNES CECILIA is the second feature of the Swedish director and, as soon as it was released, the national press unanimously acknowledged the aspects of this film, worthy of a masterpiece, and even compared GRÖNROS to SPIELBERG, HITCHCOCK, or TRUFFAUT. He received the Swedish Oscar, the GULDBAGGE, for Best Director in 1992. “Making a film about the unknown as if it is the reality, which means showing that each day of our life can actually contain more dimensions than those we can perceive through our five senses”: this is the statement and bet made by the Swedish director, remarkably helped by Gloria Tapia, the young actress playing the role of Nora."

After having loot $15,000 and a huge shipment of cocaine, the vicious trio heads for Houston, where it intends to sell the drug to a dealer before reaching Star City, a small and miserable town in Arkansas where Fantasia grew up. The Los Angeles Police Department assigns two veterans - Dud, an alcoholic and tired cop and his partner Mc Feely – to the rather reluctant mission of apprehending the dangerous murderers. They rapidly find the track and destination of the trio's getaway and decide to set a trap in Star City. Once there, they have to collaborate with the hearty and ambitious Sheriff Dale ""Hurricane"" Dixon, for whom this case is the perfect opportunity to escape from his daily routine and to prove that he is a good cop.

ONE FALSE MOVE is a breathtaking, violent, and bloody thriller where the simplest mistake can be deadly. This is the first feature of an African-American director who made his debut by shooting low-budget films for Concorde, the production company of Roger CORMAN. Following the screening of his graduation short film, PUNK, he is hired to direct ONE FALSE MOVE. He gathered excellent actors for this film such as Bill PAXTON (ALIENS, NEAR DARK), in the role of the naive and moving sheriff, Cynda WILLIAMS (MO’ BETTER BLUES, JUNGLE FEVER) who plays Fantasia, Billy Bob THORNTON (THE OUTSIDERS) interprets her boyfriend Ray, and Jim METZLER (RIVER'S EDGE) and Earl BILLINGS (WIRED) are the policemen. The film was released in 1992 in the USA, it was a huge success in theaters, and it received outstanding critics by the American press. This film should certainly delight all thriller fans of the Festival."

Both are trying to rebuild their lives after being struck by a tragic event. From the first day of school, Jeff is the victim of the aggressiveness of Clyde, a violent boy whose only desire is to bully those weaker than him.

As he is an unloved child, Drew devotes all his affection to Zowie, his dog. But one day, Zowie is mercilessly killed by Gus. Jeff and Drew decide then to bury the dog in the cursed cemetery. Ludlow is going to face horrific events again.

""Beware of your wishes, for they may come true…"": here is in a nutshell the theme of PET SEMETARY TWO, the sequel of PET SEMETARY, an adaptation of the famous novel of Stephen King. Still directed by Mary LAMBERT, this film promises to be much more than a sequel. The characters’ personality is presented in a deeper way and the revived corpses are no longer ordinary and brainless zombies: each one of them has its own desires, which offers many more possibilities to the director, than simply written characters, who takes the opportunity to reinterpret the story. To delight of all, Mary LAMBERT does not fail to make an even more terrifying film. On top of that, the special effects and the performance of Edward FURLONG (TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY) as Jeff are spectacular."

Therefore, Bobby and his older brother get to work and take up the challenge of one of their fellow inventors, whose first attempt failed and left him crippled. But where he failed, the two siblings succeed, to the astonishment of their mother and the local sheriff.

Richard DONNER (SUPERMAN, LADYHAWKE, LEATHAL WEAPON, ...) seems to have swum in a fountain of youth by directing this contemporary tale that could begin with “once upon a time…”. However, R. DONNER wisely chose to approach a serious topic, the childhood victim of the adult world, through the imagination of children. Lorraine BRACCO (GOODFELLAS, MEDICINE MAN, …) plays the mother, but the main actors of this film are the young siblings, and this wolfdog that protects them like its ancestor Rin Tin Tin did in the past.

It is then under the names of Mr. Brown, Mr. Orange, and so on that they made the robbery. However, during the meeting and the sharing of the heist, the cops appear suddenly and panic sets in, every one of them trying to find out who betrayed who and how.

Do not search for a logical explanation for the title, there is none. This extremely gory film, inspired by Kubrick’s THE KILLING, offers us the most impressive slaughter ever seen on the big screen. This « Sophoclean » tragedy takes place around the same location, used as a meeting spot for mobsters. It is a unity of space but not time, because several flashbacks punctuate the film and let us take part in the organization of the robbery and its bloody epilogue. After the gun battle, during which one of the thieves is deadly wounded, the atrocious and deadly agony of a policeman and the hemoglobin will not leave the screen anymore. This agony is the guiding line of this wicked behind-closed-door feature made by Quentin Tarantino, who, not satisfied by being in charge of the direction and the screenwriting, plays a role in its own film, like Hitchcock once did. Showing us the worst kind of stupid characters, violence is the only expressed language in this bloody thriller. RESERVOIR DOGS is his first major feature (thanks to the producer Monte Hellman), which he masterfully directed, assisted by Sydney Pollack, Terry Gilliam, Jon Amiel and Volker Schlöndorff. Tarantino thus shares the screen with Harvey Keitel, who is the forever second role in detective films, playing for 25 years either a cop or a criminal.

On a moonless night, during a furious storm, he manages to reach the doorstep of a house, which, he is certain, is Laura’s refuge. But Singapore Sling is injured: a bullet went through his shoulder and his life slowly escapes through the open wound. Almost unconscious, he observes two women moving around a pit, at the back of the garden: they are struggling to bury the corpse of a man.

He waits until dawn to enter the house, and once inside, he thinks he will find Laura and revive the love story that led him into this foolish adventure. However, things are going to be different than what he imagined… and his time is running out.

Written and directed by the Greek Nikos NIKOLAIDIS (EURIDICE BA 2037, THE WRETCHES ARE STILL SINGING, SWEET BUNCH, MORNING PATROL), SINGAPORE SLING is a very personal film, with a dubious and erotic atmosphere. The hero’s delusional quest to find his beloved Laura leads him in a perverted game with two almost completely crazy women.

Julie witnesses the scene, but the criminals flee without having time to take care of her. Andrew, a police officer is now in charge of protecting Julie. He possesses a strange power that already put in danger many of his colleagues: when he touches a victim’s corpse, he falls into a trance and experiences the moment of the death through the eyes of the murderer.

During his investigation, Andrew discovers a connection between these fights and the sword’s theft. In order to get the priceless blade back, he will have to get into the ring and fight for his life.

This film by Michael KENNEDY is filled with fights. Masterfully mixing the scenes of urban violence and the concept of reincarnation, THE SWORDSMAN depicts a hero, holder of ancient wisdom, confronted to the sordid reality of contemporary big cities. Andrew, the telepathic policeman who becomes an invincible warrior, is played by Lorenzo LAMAS, well known for his role in the series FALCON CREST. Claire STANSFIELD (THE DOORS, TWIN PEAKS) is Julie Wilkins, and the inevitable villain is interpreted by Michael CHAMPION (TOY SOLDIERS, TOTAL RECALL, FATAL BEAUTY)."

The hero from TROUBLE BOUND, interpreted by Michael MADSEN (RESERVOIR DOGS, THELMA AND LOUISE) is really getting into trouble. His too short moments of glory lead him in a swirl of very big problems from which it will not be easy to escape. Fortunately, he does not lack imagination, but his partner, Patricia ARQUETTE (THE INDIAN RUNNER, ETHAN FROME), will not make things easier for him, to say the least.

The new adaptation of THE TURN OF THE SCREW, based on the distressing and wonderful story of Henry James, is the work of Lemorande (better known for his work as co-director of YENTL by B. Streisand). This second film remains faithful to the first one (THE INNOCENTS by Jack Clayton with D. Kerr) regarding the emotion and suspense of the story, and it casts an erotic infatuation that mixes with the mysterious atmosphere of the mansion and its inhabitants. The director takes up the challenge of offering a modern version (moving from England during the Victorian era to the sixties) and he wonderfully succeeds thanks to an amazing French and English cast gathering Stéphane Audran, Olivier Debray, Patsy Kensit and Marianne Faithfull.

Lewis Teague made his debut as director under the supervision of Roger CORMAN, of whom he was the favorite student. Lewis TEAGUE is a B-movie specialist and was noticed by SPIELBERG just after the making of CUJO (Stephen KING’s novel). He releases shortly after THE JEWEL OF THE NILE, second part of ROMANCING THE STONE (with Michael DOUGLAS and Kathleen TURNER). He then directed CATS EYES, which is also an adaptation from KING’s short story. His latest film as director, WEDLOCK, has been compared to THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, one of the wonders of the US fantastic cinema. For this futuristic action film, Teague worked with Rutger Hauer (LADYHAWKE, BLADE RUNNER, HITCHER, but also SPLIT SECOND and PAST MIDNIGHT, screened during the Festival in 1992) and Mimi Rogers (SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME, DESPERATE HOURS...)."
1993,movie ,,,PLEINS FEUX SUR L'ASSASSIN,Georges Franju,1961,France,,,"Pierre Brasseur, Pascale Audret,Marianne Koch",,,,,,,95',"Drama, Mystery, Thriller ",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0055308,?ref_=nm_knf_t3",,,,,"In a castle on the edge of the Loire, the count of Kerloquen (Pierre Brasseur), a strange old man who has been forgotten by all for ages, decides to leave the world of the living and hides to die. His inheritors, who were called by the doctor, learn that the body has not been found yet and that they will have to wait 5 years to receive their part of the inheritance. Until then, they will have to pay for the upkeep of the castle and the outbuildings. They decide to set up a « sound and light » show telling the story of the family and the income of it would cover the costs of the upkeep. But during the rehearsals, a series of mysterious deaths begins…

This third film directed in 1961 by Franju, founder of the Cinémathèque Française with Langlois and Mitry, almost got lost after it was shot, which is ironic when knowing that Franju’s biggest concern was saving films, every one of them! And now one of his own films vanishes! After his death, some research led to the film, which was found in a laboratory, but under its original and premonitory name: LE CHÂTEAU DES MYSTÈRES. The negative of the film was undamaged and, after solving some minor legal issues, a copy was made. This film may seem a bit trivial compared to Franju’s filmography, but he had to direct it with the means at hand and following the producers’ instructions. At least, it has the advantage of offering a light and easy-going humor, which is uncommon in Franju’s work. He also tries to avoid the detective film side in order to preserve a pure fantastic atmosphere. During an interview in 1959, he said to François Truffaut: ""What entertains me is giving life to emptiness. I really enjoy doing that. The presence and the movements of the invisible characters are revealed, and that could not be closer to the truth, by “the intervention” of the cinema, and by the position and the motion of revealing devices. It is necessary that the darkness speak, and that the perception of the human presence is created.”"
1993,movie ,"The Night, 11th Fantastic Night",,CLIVE BARKER: THE ART OF HORROR,Christopher Holland,1992,Canada,,,"Clive Barker, Robert Russell",,,,,,,30',"Documentary,  Horror ",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt1756454,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0",,,,,"Clive BARKER is not an ordinary guy. Not only he is the director of HELLRAISER and NIGHTBREED, two of the most impressive and innovative horror films of the last few years, but also the author of several novels and short stories that surpass by far most of the contemporary fantastic literature. Besides, he is also a very talented illustrator, whose most notable graphic influences are William Blake, Jerome Bosch, and Francisco Goya.
The numerous aspects of his personality and work are depicted in this documentary, where Barker reveals his personal universe and baroque fantasies, which are reflected in his work through images and texts. What constitutes Clive Barker’s originality is his honesty regarding the process of creation: where most of the fantastic authors are always harping on about the same banalities, Barker allows himself to use only one recipe: his delicate, versatile, and always surprising imagination. THE ART OF HORROR lets us dive fully into it and illustrates his sayings through various film extracts and footage, allowing us to explore the places where the films were shot. This documentary also tries to answer a basic question about the horror genre: Why are we so fascinated by the culture of fear? 

The director Christopher HOLLAND, organizer of the B-Series Festival in Canada, called on the expertise of Leonard MALTIN,a respected film critic, and the British actor Robert RUSSEL, whose voice accompanies the spectators through the film. Christopher YOUNG, author of the soundtracks of HELLRAISER and THE FLY 2, composed the music."
1993,movie ,"The Night, 11th Fantastic Night",,THE RESURRECTED,Dan O'Bannon,1991,USA,,,"John Terry, Jane Sibbett, Chris Sarandon",,,,,,,108',Horror,,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0105242,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0",,,,,"Charles Dexter Ward, a wealthy scholar from New England, is obsessed by the work of one of his ancestors, Joseph Curwen, a 17th-century alchemist. Lately, Ward seems to have been affected by a curious silence and his behavior is extremely disturbing. He spends days locked up in Curwen’s old farm that he transformed into a laboratory. Concerned about the sudden change of his behavior, Claire, his wife, decides to hire a private detective to reveal his strange secret. John March, whose business is not going well lately, accepts the job. His first findings suggest that Ward is nothing but an eccentric, but he quickly finds new evidence proving that he was wrong. Through the investigation, he witnesses strange events: deliveries of meat and animal blood, the discovery of coffins containing human body parts and the gruesome death of a neighbor, probably too curious, devoured by dogs… according to the police. Besides, a mysterious stranger appears called Dr. Ash…

Based on the famous short story of H.P. LOVECRAFT: “THE CASE OF CHARLES DEXTER WARD”, Brent V. Friedman wrote THE RESURRECTED, a fascinating adaptation of immortality, a theme as old as the hills. Dan O'BANNON (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD) has been dreaming for ages to put on the screen this morbid tale, coming straight out of the imagination of one of his favorite authors. But the respected screenwriter of ALIEN and TOTAL RECALL chose to direct this adaptation of the classic fantastic literature himself. Ward is interpreted by a regular of the fantastic genre: Chris SARANDON (FRIGHT NIGHT, CHILD'S PLAY, THE SENTINEL). John Marsh, the stubborn detective, is played by John TERRY (IN COUNTRY, FULL METAL JACKET, THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS...), who shares the screen with one of the most promising actresses playing Claire, the beautiful Jane SIBBET, who can be seen in SANTA BARBARA or in series such as 21 JUMP STREET and CHEERS."
1993,movie ,"The Night, 11th Fantastic Night",,SEVERED TIES,Damon Santostefano,1991,USA,,,"Oliver Reed, Elke Sommer, Garrett Morris",,,,,,,92',"Comedy, Horror, Science-Fiction",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0101368,?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_18",,,,,"Dr. Harrisson Harrison, a young and talented geneticist, works on a revolutionary medical treatment which could shake up the modern conception of medicine and raise its creator to the rank of benefactor of the humanity. This magic formula allows nothing less than proceeding an organ transplantation without surgery (by stimulating the regeneration of cellular tissues). Harrisson’s mother is highly interested in her son’s experiments, but only from a financial point of view. As the outcome of these experiments are imminent, she and her lover (Dr. Vaughan, a well-known but untalented professor) do not take their eyes off their cash cow. For that, they did not hesitate to install security cameras in every corner of the laboratory. These two vultures are constantly staring at the monitoring screen and are ready to burst in the room as soon as the result of these long years of research is finally synthesized in a test tube.

Damon SANTOSTEFANO happily mixes horror and burlesque and offers us SEVERED TIES, his first feature, which is a relevant caricature of the contrasting relation between medical research (preferably altruist and disinterested) and the economic importance that the marketing of these outcomes represents nowadays. – The usurper professor is interpreted by Oliver REED (TOMMY, SPASMS, TRIPLE ECHO, TEN LITTLE INDIANS). Billy MORRISSETTE (PUMP UP THE VOLUME, BONNIE AND CLYDE: THE TRUE STORY) plays the genius of a family that is particularly unworthy to be called like that considering the guiltiness his own mother (Elke SOMMER), who combines every flaw of our contemporary society, makes him feel."
