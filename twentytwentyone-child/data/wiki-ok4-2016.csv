The rundown farm of their progenitor is not only home to numerous animals great and small, but also to three man who turn out to be their brothers. Just like Gabriel and Elias, they have a cleft palate, but they communicate mostly through verbal and physical violence. The duo attempt to bond with their siblings while trying to find out what their father was up to all these years; The truth will shock them to the core.

Anders Thomas Jensen is back! The only director to ever score a triple at the BIFFF (Golden Raven, Silver Méliès and the Audience Award for Adam’s Apples in 2006) treats us to another gem of a pitch-black comedy with fantastic undertones. Men and Chicken is absurd, obscene, hilarious and unforgettable. You won’t believe your eyes when you see how Denmark’s finest beat up each other with stuffed animals, transform a home for the elderly into a brothel, transgress the boundaries of decency and hygiene and create a breakthrough in human genetics. And we’re talking about Mads Mikkelsen (Adam’s Apples, Casino Royale), David Dencik (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), Nikolaj Lie Kaas (The Green Butchers, Angels & Demons), Sören Malling (Borgen, A Hijacking) and Nicolas Bro (War Horse, Adam’s Apples)."

After a zombie epidemic, self-defense against the undead was added to the curriculum. Mr. Bennet, the proud father of five daughters, has trained his offspring in using a wide array of weapons to fend off foul smelling suitors. The world might be ending, but if you can’t find a suitable and preferably rich husband for your daughter, you will be a disgrace to society. And that is Mrs. Bennet’s job. She wants to marry her eldest, Elizabeth, to their new neighbor, the slimy vicar Mr. Collins. But Lizzie has her eyes on the handsome soldier George Wickham. And then there’s rich but insufferable Mr. Darcy, who’s also keen on Elizabeth. Plenty of romantic entanglements, but you can be certain zombies will mess up any possible wedding.

“It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife… that can cut off the head of a zombie in one swift blow.” is probably how Jane Austen would have started her legendary 1813 classic if our undead friends would have been around. The bestselling 2009 rewrite by Seth Grahame Smith and the resulting comic strip has now become a major feature with a top notch cast. Austen’s tale has been adapted for the screen countless times, but what writer-director Burr Steers (Igby Goes Down, 17 Again), has concocted has to be seen to be believed. Prepare yourself for a dashing swashbuckling adventure where even hordes of zombies are incapable to stop the smoldering romance. Starring Lily James (Wrath of the Titans, Cinderella) and Sam Riley (Control, On The Road) as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy and Charles Dance (The Imitation Game, Game of Thrones) and Sally Phillips (Bridget Jones) as Mr and Mrs Bennet. With tasty supporting roles by Lena Headey (Cersei from Game of Thrones), Douglas Booth (Jupiter Ascending) and Jack Huston (American Hustle). "

That they were invited by Will’s ex-wife Eden and her new husband David doesn’t make it much easier, especially since they divorced two years ago after a traumatic event. Luckily their old friends also received an invitation; the couples Tommy and Miguel and Gina and Choi, who’s late as usual, and happy singles Ben and Claire. Conversation isn’t exactly sparkling, as they’ve seemed to have grown a bit apart. The atmosphere doesn’t improve when Sadie and Pruitt join the company. Eden and David got to know them in the therapy group where Eden tried to heal from the event that drove her and Will apart. The hours go by and Will is feeling more and more uneasy. There’s something particularly disturbing in the air, or is he just imagining things?

Karyn Kusama is one of the most talented female genre directors in America. She debuted with the raw and hard-hitting Girlfight (2000), followed by the big budget scifi epic Aeon Flux (2005) and the horror sensation Jennifer's Body (2009). The Invitation, awarded by our sister festivals of Sitges, Neuchâtel and Strassbourg, is a genuine tour de force and a triumph of ensemble acting. Eighty minutes long Kusama feeds the audience with paranoia and tension simmering under the surface until the crushing finale which will leave you gasping for breath."

Inside, the never-ending shoot raises tensions between the stars, the extra’s and the staff. Presenting couple Roberto and Christina hate each other’s guts. Old glory Alphonso and rising young star Adán bicker it out who’ll be the first to perform, while female fans of the latter try to steal his sperm to blackmail him with an unexpected pregnancy. Yuri, Alphonso’s son, manager and punching-bag, has smuggled in psychopath and superfan Oscar to murder his father. And with the extras there’s love in the air between José and Paloma, a woman who’s a real disaster magnet. And that’s only the start.

What would the Bifff be like without a movie from Alex de la Iglesia, the man who has already won three Golden Raven with The Day of The Beast, The Last Circus and Witching & Bitching!? My Big Night is an exuberant black comedy with more plot twists and story lines than hairs on a dog. Hilariously brutal and merciless, de la Iglesia presents this ballet of clashing ego’s as a biting satire on the entertainment industry. And of course there’s a top notch cast of Spanish talent to shower the story with a bonfire of machine-gun dialogues, including Hugo Silva (Witching & Bitching), Carlos Areces (The last Circus), Carolina Bang (Shrew’s Nest), Santiago Segura (Pacific Rime) and Spanish music legend Raphael as Alphonso."

His creation was driven by a mysterious energy source called The Origin. After scared farmers killed the maker, his children and Arti were forced to become nomads. Mo, the older brother, takes care of Arti and searches for information about The Origin. His younger sister Tong passes most of her time honing her martial arts skills. The next stop on their journey is the kingdom of Lou-lan along the Silk Road. But they have to watch out for sandworms that are attacking the villages on the road. Then Prins Angelo invites Mo and Arti-C to participate in a martial arts tournament. If they win, he’ll help them solve the mystery of The Origin. The key seems to be with the mysterious Lop people.

It’s not every day that you see a fantasy adventure movie with hand puppets. And there seems to be only one family in Taiwan that still makes these puppets and that can play with them. The craftsmanship is astonishing and the care and detail put into the beautiful sets gushes from the screen. The movie contains a lot of digital special effects, but a lot less than you might think, because it’s, of course, the puppets that steal the show, whirling around and fighting all the time in the best wuxia tradition. Director Huang Wen-Chang and his team have given us a very rare pearl, a unique mix of martial arts, steampunk, fantasy and puppets."

It also doesn’t help that the small town where they moved to from Sydney is plummeted by endless rainfall. Peter starts to see new patients, but if there’s anyone in need of therapy, it’s more likely to be him. The unannounced visit of a strange teenage girls sets in motion a series of events that make clear that Peter is not only haunted by his tragic past. 

Backtrack is the feature debut of successful scriptwriter Michael Petrioni (The Rite, The Chronicles of Narnia). This supernatural thriller brings to mind Nicolas Roeg’s classic Don’t Look Now. It’s a bold reference, but the mystery and the acting are up to par with this illustrious predecessor. Especially if the latter is being taken care of by the likes of Adrien Brody (The Pianist, King Kong, Splice) and Sam Neill (Jurassic Park, Event Horizon, In the Mouth of Madness)."

The Chinese government organizes an expedition led by professor Yang to excavate the fossils. One of its members, the young soldier Hu Bayi, is in love with Ping, the beautiful daughter and assistant of the professor. After an explosion collapses a part of the tunnels, Yang asks for volunteers to accompany him and Ping to search for another passage. Hu and some others volunteer and a small group sets of for a dangerous journey through a treacherous subterranean labyrinth. After they are almost decimated by a group of lethal fire bats, the survivors fall into a bottomless chasm. To their astonishment, they awake alive and well at the bottom. While looking for a way out, they stumble upon a mysterious temple. And it seems that the professor was looking for that all along. 

After four acclaimed arthouse movies, director Lu Chuan (The Last Supper) makes a successful transition to the realm of special effects driven blockbusters. He succeeds in perfectly capturing an atmosphere of wonder, mystery and intrigue. It’s as if you’re looking at a Chinese version of Jules Verne’s Journey to the Center of the Earth with a good dash of H.P Lovecraft. Humor, romance, spectacle and astounding sfx; Chronicles of the Ghostly Tribe can rival with the best of Hollywood."

He sees himself as a supporting character in his own life and his low self-esteem results in frustration. One day, the world as Hideo knows it is shattered by a disease that turns people into homicidal maniacs, whose first instinct is to attack and devour the nearest human. Armed with only his sporting shotgun, Hideo runs for his life, meeting strangers along the way. All the while, he and his companions struggle to stay alive, while questioning their moral choices.

I Am A Hero is nothing less than the Japanese The Walking Dead. Kengo Hanazawa’s horror manga paints quite an original picture of the now familiar zombie apocalypse. The undead, or ZQN as they’re called, remain stuck in their daily routines, which is used for great comic and horrific relief in both the manga and the film adaptation by Shinsuke Kaneko (The Princess Blade, Gantz). Hideo Suzuki is probably one of the most reluctant and unlikely (anti)heroes ever. And once he really starts using his shotgun, you’d better run for cover. I Am A Hero is one of the essential zombie movies of the year."

Tasked with protecting a local queen, James is taken with Tulaja, a royal warrior working to defend her realm, only to face all sorts of betrayal and dangerous encounters. Escaping into the wilds of India, James is unable to ignore his attraction to Tulaja, despite his duties to the British Army, that has to face a cunning enemy. Back in a hospital room, Laura is pressured to make a decision about Jay’s life, trying desperately to think of a way to revive her husband. 

The Lovers is a sweeping romance, time-travel sci-fi tale, and gallant period piece all at once by acclaimed writer-director and 2013 Bifff juror Roland Joffe (The Killing Fields, The Mission, City of Joy). And it’s a Belgian coproduction! His swashbuckling fantastic tale looks like a Hindu version of Out of Africa mixed with Cloud Atlas, with the leads taken care of by Josh Hartnett (Sin City, The Faculty, Penny Dreadful), his real-life wife Tamsin Egerton (The Brothers Grimsby, Camelot) and Bollywood princess Bipasha Basu."

Drunk as a skunk he enters his home where he sobers up in an instant when he sees the dead body of his wife. A year later, the murder investigation has hit a dead end and Dong-ho has become an emotional wreck. Then, one day, an anomaly in the magnetic field makes his smartphone vibrate.

Dong-ho soon understands that he can change the past and will try to do all he can to prevent the murder on his wife. But changing the past will have dramatic consequences for the present. 
With a pitch that reminds you of Gregory Hoblit’s Frequency, this feature debut of Bong-joo is quite unique in Korean cinema. What you get is a razor-sharp and tense thriller with fantasy elements in which the viewer is swept away by the relentless race against and with time. With strong performances from Seong-woo Bae (Bedevilled) and Jang-in Sub (A Hard Day, No Tears For The Dead)."

And then they stumble upon a settlement in the mountains. Father and son only want a bit of food, warmth and shelter, but the reception they receive from the inhabitants is more like a cold shower. Woo-ryong discovers that the place is cursed with a plague of flesh-eating rats who do not even recoil from nibbling at babies. Fortunately, he’s just the guy they need. He proposes to use his unique skills to rid the village of the carnivorous rodents. In return he wants them to treat his son. But the sting is in the tail, and we’re not talking about a rat’s tail.

The Pied Piper, the notorious fairytale by the Brothers Grimm, has often been adapted to the big screen, notably by Jacques Demy. But this Korean version of the story that has given sleepless nights to generations of children clearly rises above the rest. The feature debut of Kwang-tae Kim excels in the wondrous and the macabre, giving the tale a modern makeover while remaining true to its gruesome spirit. Kim injects ever more horror into the story, building up to a horrific finale that will nail you to your seats."

The authorities hermetically close off the city center and decide to wait out the end of the outbreak, until there’s no one left…

The latest film from acclaimed animation director Seon Sang-ho (The Fake, The King of Pigs) is a unique mix of zombie horror and social criticism. Yeon doesn't look at the class struggle through the perspective of Karl Marx, but deals with it in the spirit of George Romero, resulting in a movie that is both compelling and eminently political.

A desolated bus stop in the middle of nowhere and five hours away from the nearest city. Outside, a never-ending rain turns roads into swimming pools. Inside, eight people are desperately trying to find a way out of this hellhole. Ulises, for example, is eager to get back to his wife, who’s giving birth in one of the capital’s nurseries. Next to him sits an old Indian woman mumbling incomprehensive gibberish and looking like a Peruvian witch straight out of a child’s nightmarish bedtime story. Sitting in the corner is a pregnant woman who just left her abusive husband after bashing in his skull that very morning. It is in this charming setting that things are about to go from extremely bad to the absolute worst. The radio announces that acid rains is about to cover the globe. Anyone who’ll come in contact with this phenomenon will more than likely have to kiss their pretty face goodbye.

Isaac Ezban, who was one of last year’s BIFFF guests with The Incident, returns with this terrific homage to 60ties scifi. With a direct influence from Rod Sterling’s The Twilight Zone, The Similars present a blend of Cold War paranoia, mindfucks, schizophrenia, a significant amount of hemoglobin and an ensemble cast led by none other than Gustavo Sanchez Parra (Man on Fire, Legend of Zorro, Amores Perros)."

This leads him to discover the secret identity of his father. He’s not a farmer who specializes in cured meats, as Adolfo has believed all his life. He’s secret agent Anacleto, a superspy who locked up Vázquez in jail thirty years ago and got laid off because of cutbacks. Adolfo will have to leave his comfort zone and work together with his father, the very person that Adolfo hates most in the world, to survive the revenge of Vazquez and, in between shootouts and chases, to get his girlfriend back.

Finally! It took three years, but now Javier Luiz Caldera, director of Ghost Graduation (Golden Raven and Audience Award at the BIFFF 2013) is back with a new film. He has adapted the popular comic-strip of Manuel Vazquez Gallego and turned it into a spectacular action parody on Mr. Shaken Not Stirred with a Spanish twist. True to its source material, the movie bursts with comic-book energy. Grizzled veteran Imanol Arias (The Flower of My Secret, Paper Birds) is Anacleto, Agente Secreto. Quim Gutierrez (The Hidden Face, Who Killed Bambi) is Adolfo and Carlos Areces (Game of Werewolves, My Big Night) plays arch nemesis Vazquez.

As she bent over to pick up her pen, the deadly breeze decided to detach her classmate’s upper bodies. Fleeing towards the nearest forest while it’s raining human torsos, Mitsuko ends up at a school where she doesn’t recognize anyone but her best friend Aki. Fortunately, she’s still in one piece. Is she having a nightmare? Was her Bento box poisoned? Mitsuko doesn’t have the time to get her head straight, as more people are losing theirs when two teachers decide to deal with their burn out with some good old fashioned school shooting. The best plan would be to leave this hellhole, but the wind keeps blowing outside…

With an already spectacular entrance, the new film by Sion Sono raises the bar very high only to come down when the credits roll. The newest feature from this Japanese Stakhanov (with 5 movies in 2015), an adaptation of Yusuke Yamada’s novel, is closer to Tokyo Tribe than to Love Exposure.

When they’re not torturing amps with their rock band, they’re behind the cash desk of the local supermarket, owned by Colleen’s dad, practice funky yoga moves with guru Yogi Bayer or execute everyone who dares to enter their field of vision with lethal one-liners. But there are exceptions, like handsome Ichabod from Senior High, who invites them to a party at his house. That’s actually just an excuse to ritually murder the Colleens for some satanic ritual. Luckily, the noise from their band awakens a slumbering evil or maybe we should say a whole lot of little evils. The creatures start terrorizing the town, looking for a very specific sort of victim who becomes the subject of a devastating anal probe. The cavalry arrives in the person of the notorious monster hunter Guy Lapointe. He’ll help the Colleens to survive this hellish night.

Yoga Hosers is the second part of Kevin Smith’s Northern trilogy, which started with Tusk and which will close with next year’s Moose Jaws. Colleen and Colleen, played by the daughters of Kevin Smith and Johnny Depp, were already part of the party in Tusk, but in Yoga Hosers they’re like a 21st century version of Clerks, Smith’s hilarious and unforgettable debut feature. Yoga Hosers is a non-stop avalanche of nonsense, gore and advanced culture critic for nerds, with a totally unrecognizable Johnny Depp as Guy Lapointe and a bunch of guest parts and cameo’s by the likes of Haley Joel Osment, Natasha Lyonne, Stan Lee, Vanessa Paradis, Adam Brody and Genesis Rodriguez.

This is mostly lost on the local drunkards, as they are not always easy to distinguish from zombies themselves. But Steve, Branka and Joschi have to find a way to survive this hellish night.

Apparently director Dominik Hartl got the idea for his film (of which the title tells you everything you need to know) by observing drunken tourists at the after-ski parties in the snow resorts of the Alps. And the result is a whole lot more than a joke taken too far. Attack of the Lederhosenzombies finds inspiration from illustrious predecessors such as Shaun of the Dead and Braindead and had the special effects team of The Hunger Games at its disposal for the necessary guts and gore. Ever wanted to see Heidi literally yodeling her lungs (and intestines) out? Then this is the movie for you!"

Preceded by a reputation for gore and horror, Can Evrenol’s first feature will make the stomach of several spectators turn. But there’s a unique universe behind the shocking visuals.

Mixing the themes of high school dropout and torture porn is an alternative take on social drama and who better to capture this on camera than Ruth Platt, an Oxford graduate in Literature.

Of course, being a teenager sometimes makes you unable to learn any lessons. That is why four young Russians decide to take a closer look at the urban legend of the Queen of Spades. Instead of shooting with their Counter Strike comrades, they stand in front of a mirror and begin to summon evil spirits. Now, to be honest, in most of these cases, the “spirit” you want to talk to ends up being your drunken uncle booing behind a curtain. Unfortunately for them, this is not the case here. Not only does our Queen enjoy scaring young Russian studs, but she seems to have taken a good look at horror classics such as The Exorcist and The Shining. Definitely a force to be reckoned with.

If you are looking for a revival of the classic horror genre, look no further than Moscow. The first wave is ready to launch and is backed up with blockbuster budgets. Queen of Spades is the first in a wave of new horror films. Mother Russia is out to scare you and, as we know from history, there’s no way of stopping her."

Alberto Marini is well established as a producer (Rec., Sleep Tight) and as a writer (Retribution, Extinction), but he’s finally decided to widen his range with this refreshing twist to the slasher genre. Marini loves to mess with conventions and with our heads, as everybody gets their turn to be the murdering maniac and the screaming victim, which infuses a lot of emotion and feeling into what are mostly two-dimensional characters in the genre. But gorehounds do not need to worry. Plenty of blood is spilled in brutal confrontation with various improvised weapons. "

The cause is an unknown virus that seems to be spreading rapidly. It’s serious enough for the government to take drastic measures. Sorgenfri is closed off from the outside world. Then the inhabitants are ordered to stay inside at all times. Some disagree and try to flee, but the response of the ever more present military is swift and lethal. Finally all homes are hermetically sealed. The days go by. Food becomes scarce and there’s no cure in sight. Desperate times call for desperate measures. 

When you’re a character in a horror movie, the most horrible things can happen to you. But if you, as the viewer, feel completely nothing for all those unlucky souls on the screen, you might as well switch to the Disney channel. Danish director and screenwriter Bo Mikkelsen has understood this. He takes the time to let us get to know the characters, so that we can bond with them and feel for them when their carefree world becomes ever smaller and more dangerous, until the only choices left are the ones that will tear them apart. What We Become is definitely one of the best European horror films of last year."

England went crazy about it, now it is time to unleash the beast in Bozar
Even if Aaaaaaaah is Steve Oram’s first feature, this doesn’t mean that he’s new to the game. Mostly know from his TV appearances, Steve Oram recently featured in the absurd killer comedy Sightseers by Ben Wheatley. For his debut he surrounded himself with some great entertainers from the small and big screen: Noel Fielding (IT Crowd), Julian Barratt (ABCs of Death 2), Tony Way (Doctor Who, Derek, Game Of Thrones), Alice Lowe (Hot Fuzz, Sightseers).

After young and upcoming director Micky Keating tackled satanic terror in Ritual (2013) and scifi paranoia in pod (2015), he now delivers a true arthouse horror feast. In the best tradition of films in which the protagonist slowly sinks away into madness (of course shot in glorious black & white images), Darling goes straight for your guts and pulls no punches. Tension, paranoia and uncertainty nibble away the already fragile comfort layers of the lead, a great performance by Ashley Carter (The Woman, Jug Face), until only insanity remains. With genre veterans Sean Young (Blade Runner, Ace Ventura) and Larry Fessenden (You’re Next, We Are What We Are) as solid backups.    "

While scorpions are replacing ants, our man’s hold over his gun strengthens as the sun goes down and a pitch black night swallows everything.

After having made his mark with crime movies such as The Octopus, A Private Affair and The Key, French director Guillaume Nicloux ventures into 7th Orbit territory, that section of the Bifff where movies go strange and unexpected places. Valley of Love, which was nominated last year for the Cannes Golden Palm, was already a mysterious viewing experience. And his lead from that film, French acting monument Gérard Depardieu, is again the center of this unique, hypnotizing and fascinating surreal odyssey where the trees are not what they seem."

But her precious prince keeps her waiting and locals turn out to be a whole lot more savage that what is mentioned in the glossy tourist brochures. Chlamydia has to go on the run and ends up in the lair of the misanthropic scientist Helmut Mandragorass, a specimen of the male race not exactly blessed with dashing looks as his protruding forehead dwarves everything else. Paradise isn’t always what it seems to be.

The brothers Jake and Dinos Chapman are known postmodern artists with a love for the grotesque. They adapted Jake’s book into a mini television series which then got the feature treatment. The Marriage of Reason and Squalor is a delightful burlesque pastiche and a surreal look on modern love with in the leads the incomparable Rhys Ifans (Harry Potter, The Amazing Spiderman, Snowden) and Sophie Kennedy Clark (Nymphomaniac).

At the workstation where Vernon works you can choose between going back to a four figure job or throw yourself from the highest tower.

Since its release in Korea, this first feature by Ying-ho Son has steamrolled over the Korean box-office, relegating, among others Matthew Vaughn’s Kingsman to second place. There are two reasons for that. The Deal can count on a cast from other Korean successes like Hwai: a Monster Boy, Nameless Gangster and New World.

The French action thriller Enragés (Rabid Dogs), the feature debut of producer Eric Hannezo (The Players) is a stylish and intense remake of the eponymous 1974 movie by Italian genre master Mario Bava. Enragès is a non-stop succession of car chases, shoot-outs and sizzling dialogues full of tension and fear.

Director Roh Deok worked for more than 12 years on her film, which is more related to the cynicism of Network than to the journalistic integrity of Spotlight. The Exclusive: Beat The Devil’s Tattoo mercilessly flails the obsession with scoops and exclusivity of the contemporary media where facts and the truth are just obstacles against higher ratings. This pitch-black satire with a bloody climax benefits from the acting talents of Seong-woo Bae, who seems to be very much present this year at the BIFFF, as we’ll also see him in The Phone and The Beauty Inside."

When the band sees something they weren’t supposed to see, a dangerous situation turns into a life or death siege. Prepare yourselves for gushing blood fountains and the spilling of guts. Hey Ho, Let’s Go! 

After Jeremy Saulnier’s awarded indie debut Blue Ruin, the young director got a much bigger budget for this downright impressive second feature. And all those extra millions are absolutely visible on the screen. Macon Blair, the lead in Blue Ruin, plays the owner of the skinhead bar, but it’s Patrick Stewart (Star Trek, X-Men) who steals the show as a terrific bad guy. Among the members of the punk band we recognize Anton Yelchin (Burying The Ex, Star Trek) and Imogen Poots (Need For Speed).

This time, he returns with a merciless thriller, mixing splendidly a Cold War Cold Case and a race against the clock with fierce efficiency! If John le Carré’s shadow hovers undeniably above the script, with a dissection of a policy as outdated as a red anvil, the dark package without any concession that brings a spark of Fincher sets The Photographer as an atypical and nervous work of art.

The cold shower and even threats she receives from the rest of the family upon her arrival, makes her hesitate. But she pushes through and starts to dress herself in the clothes of the girl. She even sleeps in her bed. When Yezi starts asking questions about the deceased, she gets disturbing answers. Her parents died in mysterious circumstances and her brother drowned, even though he could swim like a fish. But it’s not until she discovers the girl’s diary, that Yezi realizes in what a hornet’s nests she finds herself.

A new film from genre titan Danny Pang (The Eye, Bangkok Dangerous) is always a treat. This time he’s flying solo without his brother Oxide, delighting us with a spooky thriller that would even keep you glued to a bed of nails. Armed with a solid script, Danny plays ping pong with the truth, in the good company of Johnnie To regular Siu-Fai Cheung and Jiao Xu (CJ7, Dragon Nest). "

He can count on his team of bad boys and especially on his good friend Bae. A couple of days later there’s a problem. Bae is found death in an alley and it looks like a suicide. As if you can hit yourself with a baseball bat while jumping from the third floor? It’s no surprise that Seo Do wants to find the real killers of his friend.

Behind this respected business hides a maze of illegal actions, crooked politics and trials paid with hard earned capitalistic money. Time to find the reason why Bae was brutally killed!

And yet, a threat hangs over paradise. In 1905 a rockslide wiped away the entire village and it’s only a matter of time before it will happen again. Geologist Kristian is the man with an eye on the panic button in an early warning center. If the worst were about to happen, the inhabitants would have ten minutes to run for their lives to higher ground before a mighty tsunami would sweep away everything in its path. But his watch is soon coming to an end. His wife Udun and son Sondre are putting everything in boxes for their move to the big city. And then, while Udun spends her last hours at her job in a tourist hotel in town and Kristian is saying goodbye to his colleagues, the water levels starts to drop and sensors are shutting down.
Finally a disaster movie from Scandinavia! And the Norwegian tsunami-thriller The Wave was well worth the wait. Director Roar Uthaug, known for the horror chiller Cold Prey, will move to Hollywood next year to shoot the Tomb Raider reboot. The Wave is an outstanding catastrophic spectacle with the added bonus of gorgeous images of Norwegian scenery, impressive and realistic sfx and Norway’s two most popular actors in the lead: Kristoffer Joner (Next Door, The Revenant) as Kristian and Ane Dahl Torp as Idun (Dead Snow, TV’s Occupied)."

Bloodsucking Bastards wants to lengthen this list. In any business where dead-end jobs are piling up, there is always one crazy guy trying his best. Evan is convinced that this time he will motivate the call center to sell a revolutionary tool for micro penises. Behind his motivation lies a possible promotion as assistant manager, the dream of every office drone. But that job goes to Max, his arch rival since college. Max always hated Evan because he made him finish his studies in Romania. However, this has ensured that Max has learned some unique skills in Transylvania to improve the team spirit. Every evening he organizes parties. The best worker is personally thanked. Not with a useless watch or a golden pen, but with two fangs in his neck. Capitalism Sucks, literally.

Behind this horror comedy, the bastard child of Tom Holland’s Fright Night and Vampires Sucks, there’s Dr. God (LA Comedy Club). Take the characters from The Office, add the humor from Shaun Of The Dead, replace zombies by vampires and voila: Bloodsucking Bastards.

Aunt Mary and Uncle Albert are deeply religious and do not look kindly upon the heavy metal passion of their nephew. And their son David is the school’s bully. Luckily there’s Zed, the only other metalhead in town, who takes Brodie under his wings. The duo start a band, together with the two other school outcasts Dion and Giles. And Medina, the gorgeous blonde girlfriend of David, is not entirely insensitive to the noise they make. Then Zed gets the genius idea to break into an abandoned house that is rumored to be the hideout of Rikki Daggers, the singer of the legendary band M.I.A. Daggers is not fond of visitors and chases them out, but they’ve picked up a little souvenir, a musical score. They think it’s an undiscovered song from M.I.A. But what they’ve got in their hands is a composition to invoke demons. You can guess what follows next.
 
Deathgasm is an irresistible mix of heavy metal, gore & horror and comedy. The feature debut of New Zealand writer and director Jason Lei Howden seems to be custom made for the Bifff audience. Deathgasm is deliciously dirty, trashy as fuck and very generous with blood and limbs. And we haven’t even mentioned the very creative use of sex toys to combat demons. Heavy Metal and horror are the ideal marriage on stage. It’s unbelievable that this is so rare on the big screen, but Deathgasm more than fills this gap."

A few years ago a video clip directed by Illya Naishuller for his band Biting Elbows went viral on the internet. The breathtaking non-stop pursuit of a supernatural gizmo in first person shooter perspective was also seen by Timur Bekmambetov, the Russisian maestro of the action thriller, who thought it would make a terrific long feature. With Bekmambetov as producer, Naishuller transformed his concept into an energetic, kinetic, adrenaline charged scifi action epic bursting with sick humor and extreme violence.

It’s up to Syanna to convince them to join her, but to achieve that she has to win one final game against the best players of Mortemonde, Isaac Ravengorn and Alexander Torquemada.

Battledream Chronicle is the first animated feature from the Caribbean island of Martinique. Director Alain Bidard’s labor of love took 5 years to make and was done on the tiny budget of 400.00 €. Not that it shows on the screen, but it’s not the beautiful visuals of this bleak future that are Battledream Chronicle’s biggest force. This fantastic adventure for young and old possesses true heart and is an ode to friendship, courage and integrity and an indictment against real and virtual tyranny."

This is linked to the dangers of surfing the many obscure chat sites on the internet, where people take on a false identity. One of these fakers is Jeff, the lead character from the movie. He pretends to be an SM mistress who’s looking for a sister to her slave Julie. That way Jeff manages to gain the trust of his victims and lure them to his flat, where a gruesome fate awaits them.
 
Laundry Man is the newest film from Johan Vandewoestijne aka James Desert. In the past he directed the cult classic Lucker the Necrophogous and produced the other Belgian cult classic Rabid Grannies. Some of his other feats are State of Mind, starring Paul Naschy and Fred Wiliamson, Parts of the Family, Engine Trouble and Purgatory.

Weird guys are shouting about the end of the world in the streets, the radio spews news flashes about a virus that makes Ebola look like a common cold and people who don’t seem to be alive (but also not really dead) have taken over the city center. And if that’s not enough, they also run into a raving serial killer who believes that God has chosen him to clean up the human race.

Banjo is his very own interpretation of The Office, but then with lots of gore and bad taste. Have you ever dreamed of a version of Clerks with blood and massacres? Welcome to this English burlesque show called Banjo."

We’ve all had this one night when we had way too much to drink. But for Woo-jin, waking up looking different is a harsh everyday reality. Since his eighteenth birthday, he has had to live with this ailment. He can turn into a man or woman and be young, old, fat, skinny, white, black, hairy or bald. Every morning is different for him. It comes as no surprise that he doesn’t have many friends. In fact he only has one and his mom, both helping him with his unusual lifestyle and his extensive wardrobe. However, his life takes a different turn when he falls in love with the gorgeous E-soo. But how will he be able to maintain his relationship with this woman, knowing he can turn from a handsome young man to a grumpy old lady in just one night! Staying awake doesn’t seem to be the solution, though.

This big screen adaptation from an American mini-series comes straight from Korea. After a career in the commercial industry, director Jong-yeol Baek presents his first full length feature. The fact that the protagonist is played by some 123 different actors is already quite the tour de force. With an interesting view on love and relationships worthy of “Groundhog Day” and “40 Days and 40 Nights”, The Beauty Inside will melt our audience’s coldest hearts."

Inventor Louis Le Prince vanishes under mysterious circumstances right after he created a device that, five years later, the Lumière Brothers will call The Cinematographer. What if they had stolen Le Prince’s idea and wacked him afterwards? The mystery remains for more than a century, until Luigi Cozzi picks up a strange book called “The Roaming Universe” in the horror museum of his pal Dario Argento. The origin of this enigmatic book troubles him and he decides to have a talk with Lamberto Bava. But it is with the help of Antonion Tentori, screenwriter of Dracula 3D, that he makes an amazing discovery. This particular science-fiction novel would have materialized during a spiritual session in modern day Rome. At the session, an old woman revealed that the key to all these mysteries comes from 1895, a time during which the Lumière Brothers had denied lending their camera to Georges Méliès for an obscure movie called “A Trip to the moon”. Not only does this film actually exist, but it raises a more intriguing question. Is our world the only one, or are there parallel universes?

With his fake documentary about an actual mystery, the mythical director of Starcrash and Contagion, delivers a world premiere to the BIFFF; a true love letter to cinema! Disguised as a horrific mockumentary, Blood on Méliès’ Moon, is an epic outsider; with constant cameos of icons from Italian genre cinema."

With his marriage ahead, he decides to fight these demons, the kind you don't want to see in a wedding gown.

The Bride was produced by Takashige Ichise (the guy who introduced us to scary black haired little girls crawling out of a TV), who claims to have given special attention to Taiwan’s local horror heritage. The Bride, directed by Lingo Hsieh and starring Chris Wu &Nikki Hsieh, definitely gives us plenty of reasons to be scared!"

One day he finds out that he has an uncle he never knew who just died. His inheritance is an old manor that has been in his family for generations. While exploring his new home, Thomas finds its infested with spider webs, worthless old baroque relics and a reputation that makes Motel Bates look like the perfect holiday inn. It’s already hard to sell a house with such a pedigree, but the manor will reveal one last secret hidden in a secret underground basement. While dusting off an old family album that looks like a rip-off of The Necronomicon, Thomas learns he also inherited a curse that dates from the crusades. It’s a gloomy story about an ancestor who screwed up big time with a comatose princess and a flock of demons who currently call the manor their home!

Inspired by the classic Brothers Grimm story, this reboot of Sleeping Beauty impresses with its unique atmosphere, reminding you of Silent Hill, The Cell and Insidious. Between mind-blowing visuals worthy of Tarsem Singh and a well-rounded know how in the style of James Wan, Pearry Teo, producer of Cloud Atlas, hits all the right notes, with beautiful Natalie Hall (True Blood, Pretty Little Liars) trapped in this countdown together with Bruce Davidson (X Men)."

This small indie film has a simple premise that will make you shudder: what if your shower curtain disappeared into an ultradimensionnal vacuum? To discover where the curtain went, just write your phone number on it. A few moments you get a call from an absolute stranger…

Jaron Henrie-McCrea cannot hide his love for Alfred Hitchcock. As well as in his debut Pervertigo and in the follow-up The Curtain a New York bathroom takes center stage. The two leads can best be described as spin-off characters from Being John Malkovitch. Often bizarre but with lots of inventive moments, they try to unravel the mystery behind the disappearing shower curtain."

He immediately shows the footage to Mister Steeley, his boss and Cassandra’s father. Steely contacts Sheriff Vogel, the spineless pussy who’s supposed to uphold the law in Cut Bank. Dwayne is already looking forward to the huge reward that should be coming his way by reporting the death of a pillar of the community.  But not everybody is as guilty, innocent or even as dead as they seem to be. Where’s the parcel that Georgie was supposed to deliver to local recluse Derby Milton. And why is he capable of anything to get his hands on it?

Director Matt Shakman has a lot of television experience, having directed episodes of hit series such as Ugly Betty, Dr. House and especially Fargo, the successful adaptation of the classic by the Coen brothers. It’s no wonder then that his feature debut threads a fine line between thriller and dark comedy, with a dose of David Lynch added to the mix. The story is terrific, thanks to the solid script by Robert Patino (The Black List). The music is courtesy of multi-awarded composer James Newton Howard (The Bourne Legacy, The Hunger Games) and the cast is downright impressive: Liam Hemsworth (The Hunger Games), Teresa Palmer (Warm Bodies), Bruce Dern (Nebraska), Billy Bob Thornton (Armageddon) and John Malkovich (Burn After Reading)."

A powerful family hires a band of mercenaries and forces Fulcanelli, a wizard and con artist, to invoke a demon with the purpose of gaining even more power. Of course, things go terribly wrong. The wizard escapes and the demon slaughters the mercenaries, with the exception of Razor. He’s the one who seals the deal to become lord of the criminal underworld. The family kidnaps Lisa, his pregnant wife, and turns her into a merciless killing machine and the spear point of their offensive against Razor. But she’s not the only threat to the crime lord. It’s only a question of time before the demon returns to claim Razor’s soul. Fulcanelli seems to be the key to stopping the demon and Razor sends out his band of sexy killer robots to find him. 

Daemonium, a mind boggling mash-up of urban wizards, killer androids, transdimensional demons, tightly clad warrior women and dystopian anarchy, is a true phenomenon. What started as a fan funded award winning internet series, has turned into a fully-fledged feature film unique in Argentinean cinema. This science-fiction/fantasy hybrid delivers a non-stop onslaught of action, mayhem, unexpected humor and countless references to manga, computer games and nerd culture. It’s directed by the godfather of Argentinean genre cinema, Pablo Parés, whom we had the pleasure to welcome at the Bifff in 2003 with the zombie comedy Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante.  Parés and his team have done wonders with limited means, creating a film that has the potential to become a cult favorite of our new digital age."

A trip to the countryside always brings joy, laughter and a copious amount of cocktails. While all you get in Belgium is rain, more rain and a whole day spent contemplating the extensive Belgian wildlife, being pigeons, pigeons and more pigeons. Nevertheless, now is not the time to be jealous of Jorge, Ale and Magu, who’ve joined their friend Apolo at his villa in the middle of the jungle. They could have spent two days playing Yahtzee and drinking Brahma, but Jorge and Apolo decide to organize a ceremony in the basement to resurrect the Honey Baron’s hidden child. And frankly, summoning a voodoo style cursed enslaver just to impress the ladies; even idiots would think this is a bad idea. And if our two geniuses had done some research on the myth, they would have stayed in Rio. Because if there is one night when you should stay away, it’s this one. So, fancy watching some pigeons now?

Besides José Mojica Marins and his alter ego Coffin Joe, there isn’t much of a horror movie tradition in Brazil. Yet producer and screenwriter M.M. Izidoro may turn things around. He focuses on the country’s animist myths with a script that is as fierce as it is efficient. It only took Rodrigo Gasparini and Dante Vescio, known for their “M is for Mailbox” segment in The ABC’s of Death, to put this terror on tape! "

And when Aoi is literally pushed off stage, ending her career for good, the path is wide open for Sarah’s first leading role. She doesn’t know that it might also be her last.

Ghost Theatre is a completely new remake of Hideo Nakata’s first feature Don’t Look Up (which is currently in the good hands of our friend Eli Roth). And what we get from Mister J-Horror is not the usual Asian horror ride. It’s more of a nostalgic, but very effective throwback to the good old creepy classics.

He summons the entire Ultra family, at that time composed of six brothers, and under the guidance of the Ultra-mother, teams them up with a mythological Buddhist character, Hanuman, well loved by the Thais. Hanuman will even get the ability to become a giant ( 40 meters! ), in the same way the Ultra's do it.
It results in cinematographic madness, a crazy mess of science-fiction, giant monsters, reincarnation, popular beliefs, epic scenes ( Hanuman fighting the sun in his charriot!) taken from Buddist and Hindu myths that will of course culminate in a titanic melee that even the most outrageous of the World Wrestling Entertainment scriptwriters could not imagine, where five giant monsters, six Ultra's and Hanuman fight it out!"

As they’re far from the nearest town, life goes on as usual in the following days. But when they take the car for a shopping run, they realize this is anything but temporary. There’s almost no more food left in the local supermarket, people are hamstring like crazy and the few news flashes that filter through on the radio suggest that the power cut is more global than local. They decide to go back home, bunker down and wait until the lights go on again. But they’ll never go on again. 

Those who expect a spectacular action epic about the end of the world should better stay at home. But those who’re in the mood for a moving drama full of emotional depth will get more than their fill in the latest film from acclaimed Canadian director Patricia Rozema (When Night Is Falling, Mansfield Park). Her adaptation of Jean Hegland’s book shows the collapse of civilization through the bond between two sisters and the ordeals they have to face to survive in this new world. Into The Forest is an illustration of the acting talents of Ellen Page (Juno, Inception) and Evan Rachel Wood (The Wrestler, Charlie Countryman) as Nell and Eva. Touching, engaging and intense; the Apocalypse has never felt this intimate as in Into The Forest."

It’s very bad timing when you’ve planned a city trip at the same time as the opening of the Gates of Hell.

A dazzling leap over a sunflower kicks-off this action-epic. This mix between Chinese wuxia martial arts styles and Korean history is top class eye-candy. Director Heung-sik Park (My Mother The Mermaid, Children of Heaven) tells an engaging, colorful tale set in gorgeous sets with fight scenes that can rival those of Zhang Yimou’s spectacles. Go-eun Kim, praised for her part in the acclaimed Coin Locker Girl, is a physically and emotionally convincing heroine, while Korean heartthrob Byung-hun Lee (I Saw The Devil, GI Joe) relishes playing the bad guy.

Jennifer is all business, so much that her busy professional life hides the emptiness of her private life. That’s why she’s alone to blow out the candles on her birthday cake in a busy bar. Ellie, on the other hand, likes to party and to please, especially if there’s an opportunity for a movie part or a photo shoot. And Madeleine has always been the odd one out. All three spend the night at the same bar, but never run into each other. Yet, the next morning, they all wake up in the same body, a clumsily stitched together patchwork of their various body parts. Who has done this to them? And how can they avenge themselves when they can’t even agree about who will move which limb?! 

Leave it to director Tyler MacIntyre and scriptwriter Chris Lee Hill to put the story of Frankenstein through the wrangler, turn it inside out and stitch it back together until you get a deliciously gory, funny and irreverent 21st century version of the classic tale with a feminist twist. Patchwork is ideal midnight movie fun with a smart story structure, where every girl gets her side of the story."

To him the search for holiness is more a halftime calling than a fulltime duty. And yet he’s chosen as the new assistant of Father Kim, the enfant terrible of the Korean clergy. Wherever there are signs of demonic possession, Kim will be there to drive out the evil. But when the limits between exorcism and harassment become blurred, his superiors decide to send a spy to secretly film Kim’s transgressions. And that person is Choi. You can imagine he’s not very enthusiastic about his task, especially as his new boss has worn down every assistant before him. When they’re facing the victim in question, Choi thinks this can be arranged with a few Hail Mary’s and some holy water, but the Evil One has other plans.

Apparently William Friedkin raised the bar for any movie about exorcism so high, that the genre seemed destined for a slow dead through watered down found footage franchises. But ultimately everything is all about keeping the faith and redemption has arrived with the debut feature of Jang Jae-hyung. Priests is refreshing, bold, socially relevant and diabolically frightening. With Kim Yun-seok (The Chaser) and Kang Dong-won (Kundo) in the leads."

That is the question our protagonist Aram has to face. To calm his nerves, he researches all soft drinks without sugar, calculates the exact start time of random point A to point B and ... practices his stranglehold grip on his senile father and colleague/prostitute which whom he has a “professional” relation. These three hobbies seem to have nothing to do with each other, but make no mistake. Behind this extravagant lifestyle, there is a plan to get everything he wants: the promotion, the respect of his son and the love of his wife. But like all crazy plans, they never go the way you want them to.

BIFFF regular Adrian Garcia Bogliano knows how to make an entrance. After I'll Never Die Alone, Here Comes the Devil and Late Phases, he’s back again, but this time he leaves his distinctive fantasy style at home. Instead we get that kind of thriller where only the Koreans seem to excel in: a gripping, nerve wrecking ride stuffed with pitch black humor. Thanks to Kubrick, we already knew that Beethoven could cause “ultraviolence”. Now you can also add Alkan’s Third Study In Minor to the list. That piano sound will haunt your dreams (or nightmares) for nights to come."

Caroline knows what this means. Her boyfriend just dumped her and she finds herself and her daughter in a new apartment that looks like Cinderella’s attic. And to remind her that she is having a shitty time, her neighbors are anything but helpful, even threatening or sexually harassing her. Add to that a house that makes as much sound as the Brussels Philharmonic. Caroline wanted something new, but what she gets is something old. And we aren’t talking about the house itself, but more about what inhabits it. You might have had a shitty AirBnB experience, but this beats everything. 

After having worked on the Wallander series, based on the novels by Henning Mankell, and on Frostbite (BIFFF 2006), Christian Hallman comes to Brussels with his very first feature: a ghost story where the house is the most important character, with stellar performances by Lana Ohlsson and Rafael Pettersson (The Bridge)."

And it’ll be hard to surpass his latest achievement. He steals the Dark Crystal before the eyes of the king of the underworld and his legions and takes it to his home city of Hu for safekeeping. Every thousand years, for one week, the crystal creates passages between Heaven, Earth and Hell. But if something would go wrong, mankind will be doomed. The gods send Zhang Daoxian, who once was Zhong Kui’s mentor, to the city to keep an eye on things during this crucial week. But the king of the underworld does not plan to sit this one out. He sends his animal demons, disguised as a travelling troupe of female dancers, to Hu to steal back the crystal. Among them is the beautiful snow demon Little Snow. It quickly becomes apparent that she and Zhong kui have a shared past.

Zhong Kui is a bit like the Chinese Van Helsing, a cop with supernatural powers and strength and a very very long patrol route: Heaven, Earth and Hell. His image can be found all over houses and offices in China. It’s a bit of a surprise then that this is the first time Zhong Kui’s adventures have been adapted for the big screen. Luckily veteran Peter Pau (The Killers, The Bride With White Hair) was behind the camera, assisted by co-director Zhao Tianyu. Get ready for a fantastic action epic with a touch of doomed romance and with Chen Kun (Flying Swords of Dragon Gate) and Li Bingbing (Transformers: Age of Extinction) as the demonic lovers."

And you wouldn’t be that wrong. Because of his gothic look, his classmates mostly greet him like a punching bag more than as an actual person. This results in our hero stabbing one of his bullies with a fork and getting expelled. Lincoln is sent to a youth rehabilitation facility, one whose inhabitants make Biff Tannen look like a choir boy. Having no other choice than to retreat into the bathroom, Lincoln screams his lungs out for help so loud he could raise the dead… in which he succeeds. Moira, the ghost of another bully victim, comes to his aid and nothing would make her happier than to slit some throats.

A favorite among film festivals, this first feature from Adam Egypt Mortimer pushes the boundaries of US slasher movies rather than exploring the been-there-done-that theme of juvenile depression. A sexier Freddy Krueger with a new jacket and a utility knife will surely raise some hell. "

It doesn’t take long before this fragile ménage-à-trois unravels in blood and violence.

The Survivalist, a hard-hitting post-apocalyptic survival drama from Northern Irish director Stephen Fingleton, grabs you by the throat thanks to the stellar performances of the three protagonists and the raw and uncompromising violence. His feature debut is a welcome antidote to the Hunger Games and the Divergent franchises of this world. This a-typical love story at the end of the world stars Martin McCann (Clash Of The Titans) as the Survivalist, Mia Goth (Nymphomaniac) as Milja and Olwen Fouere (Traders) as Kathryn."

Scripwriter Kevin Mosley and director Jeffrey Scott Lando have been working together since Savage Island (Bifff 2004). This has led to gems such as Insecticidal, Decoys 2, Goblin, Haunted High and Roboshark. The duo clearly has an unconditional love for genre cinema and in Suspension they take their passion to a higher level. Call it a classy slasher or a slasher with a difference, it’s clear that this film is a well thought out and refreshing addition to a genre that is always in danger of succumbing to its own conventions and clichés."

The ghosts that where banned to the mountains are back in the city of Taipei and they like the old dry flesh of little grannies.

When the scariest urban legend of Taiwan is made into a movie you know things will get serious. Wei-hao Cheng had the ambition to make a really spooky movie, but his cast was so scared that he needed a witch doctor daily on the set to prevent demons from spooking around. When the movie premiered, the standing ovation sounded like a collective clap that resonated as if the ghost had token possession of the entire crowd."

Four other virgins, in the heat of passion, were also given psychic powers. But their telepathic skills will not be used to get rid off their virginity. They’ll have to fight a lesbian psychic who wants to take over the world with her army of sex dolls. 
Let’s be honest, this isn’t for fanatics of Victorian times or people with the sexual morality of the pope. This crazy over-the-top and, of course, Japanese comedy has the same energy and potential as movies like Hitoshi Matsumoto’s Big Man Japan or Symbol. Sion Sono brings yet another movie to the BIFFF. And with five films on his slate in 2015, he’s starting to rival that other favorite bulimic director. Bye bye Takashi Miike, say hello to Sion Sono!"

His best friend Chen-Jun doesn’t have any problems in the relationship department, except that he only drops by when he needs to loan money for his amorous conquests.

Luckily his handsome looks help him to charm his way out of prison. Free again, he disguises himself as a policeman to continue the killing spree. And Jian-min knows exactly what to do with a dead body.

Together with director Remus Kam, Eric Cheng adapted his own cult comic-strip into a tasty and trashy killer comedy stuffed with funny visual gags and useful tips for aspiring serial-killers.

One day Kamiura gets a visit from a formidable gang of foreign assassins. They give him an ultimatum. Return to the international vampire crime syndicate he left years ago… or die. Kamiura refuses and, after a fierce fight with his assailants, is torn to pieces. But just before he dies, he bites Kagemaya, transfusing his vampire powers to him. When his pupil becomes aware of his newfound strength, he seeks vengeance for the death of his master. But the opposition is improbably strong, not to say apocalyptic.
 
Even though Takashi Miike no longer churns out five movies a year (but who would blame him after all he’s given us throughout the years: The Audition, Ichi The Killer, Sukiyaki Western Django, 13 Assassins…), a new movie from the Japanese grandmaster of genre cinema remains an event. The full title of his latest cinematic feat is Yakuza Apocalypse: The Great War of the Underworld and that’s exactly what we can expect: an exciting, ultra-violent blend of vampires, gangsters, slapstick, monster movies and popular culture."

1993, Moriarty and Murphy made their behind-the-camera debut with Die-Cycle, a priest fights a knife-wielding madman who’s also riding a motorcycle; the comedy of errors Swag (1996) follows
an inept thief; in 2004, the award-winning Waterloo Dentures kept their comedic sensibilities intact with its look at “love, loss, and rudimentary cosmetic dentistry; and with The Family Tree (2006),
Moriarty and Murphy veer into fantasy and mythology through a group of Irish pub dwellers and their knack for overwrought barroom storytelling.",,,,,,,,,,Director,,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2030805/?ref_=tt_ov_dr,,,,,

2016,edition,"Edito, Edito 2016",,Edito 2016,,,,,"Donald Trump’s terrorist invasions or George Bush Jr’s
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq are illustrations
of how storytelling has become a redoubtable weapon
to transform fiction into fact. But this specialty of
marketing and politics now also has an equivalent
in genre cinema, that has started feeding more and
more on reality for its inspiration. And when it comes
to that, the BIFFF 2016 selection is especially marked
by this anchorage in our everyday life. Whether we’re
talking about the trending illness of the moment, the
burn-out (The Lesson, Banjo, Uptake Fear...), or about
ecological worries like fossil fuels and the destructive
influence of mankind (The Wave, The Survivalist, Into
the Forest…); genre cinema is evolving more and
more into a disturbing soundboard of all the ailments
of the 21st century. Because if there were two paths
that were never meant to cross, it’s those of fantasy
and the contemporary. But we’re not here to give you
the shivers. There are already plenty of those in our
program.
And speaking about the program, the grandmasters
of shivers are once more present at our annual
celebration of fantasy. Alex de la Iglesia (My Big Night),
RobZombie (31), Takashi Miike (Yakuza Apocalypse)
or Anders Thomas Jensen (Men & Chicken) are well
represented at the BIFFF with their latest exploits,
alongside true event films such as Pride + Prejudice
+ Zombies, Hardcore Henry and The Visitors : The
Revolution ! Add to this an ever stronger Korean
delegation, and you’re in for a diabolical genre rave!
And, because we’re all one big family, we’ve decided
to invite a few friends to the party: Bai Ling (The
Crow, Red Corner, Wild Wild West), Luigi Cozzi (Starcrash,
Hercules, Contamination), Jaume Balaguero
(Rec, Sleep Tight, Fragile), Marc Caro (Delicatessen,
The City of Lost Children, Dante 01) and – last but not
least – Kevin
Smith (Clerks, Dogma, Tusk, Yoga Hosers),
who’ll join Jaume Balaguero in the Order of the
Knights of the Raven 2016.
Regarding novelties, after years of untenable pressure,
we’ve finally relented. A non-competitive section of
international short features, spread over no less than
three screening sessions, will join our already mindboggling
offer. Free Master Classes of all kinds, wacky
animations, the renowned Zombifff Parade and the
2nd Zombifff’lympics, the Vampire Ball and a whole
lot of other events will keep you busy during thirteen
unforgetable days, far far far removed from all that
trendy scaremongering in these troubled times.

characters. In this discipline, people from all walks of
life work for months to reproduce the costumes of their
favorite characters (from movies, comics, mangas, video
games, etc). On the day of the contest the fans go on
stage to present the result of their work and to entertain
the spectators. Last year the BIFFF welcomed the Belgian
selections for the European Cosplay Gathering (ECG) and

Lileven, Saya and Yanah were chosen to proudly
represent Belgium during the ECG finale that took place
at the Japan Expo in Paris, while Muralu got selected to
represent our colors at the London EuroCosplay finale.

Gregory Beghin. The web series was designed for
smartphone viewing, as if the audience was seeing
the same found footage as Lou, the journalist. The

The Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival ( BIFFF )

master class around the situation of genre movies in French
speaking Belgium.
The idea for this discussion comes from preconceptions that
genre cinema is seen as a subgenre meant for niche audiences
or as something purely commercial. But genre cinema has
given hundreds of directors its first chance to show what
they’re capable of. Without genre cinema no first movies
from Francis Ford Coppola, Sam Raimi, Stanley Kubrick,
Alejandro Amenabar, Rman Polanski, Nicholas Roeg, David
Lynch, Guillermo del Toro…
Even stranger is the fact that Belgian literature has well
respected genre authors ( just think about the fantasy
novels of Jean Ray or Georges Simenon’s police thrillers ),
but genre film project have difficulties to find funding.

• How can the public, directors, distributors,

react ?

Minority Reports: the representation of minorities
in independent cinema
The meeting/confrontation with the ‘Other’, with what is
unknown or mysterious, is a driving classical narrative style
of fantastic and science-fiction cinema. This out of the ordinary
curiosity, for what is different, raises the inevitable
question how this difference is received and, more specifically,
on the representation of minorities within independent
cinema. If aliens, mutants, monsters have a main
role in many of these fictions, it is also worth mentioning
how they represent actual minorities: blacks, handicapped
people, foreigners, transgender, etc.
From “Children of Men” to “Toxic Avenger” without forgetting
“Red Dawn”, “Shaft” and “Pink Flamingos”, what are the
images, stereotypes and identities showed by independent
cinema? How are women represented in movies that are
mostly directed by men? And, more globally, if there is a so
called “deviant” cinema, from what or who does it deviate?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This painter, who prefers disturbance to order, invites
you to plunge into the depths of an obsessive world
where no moral value is absolute. His sharp insight on
our institutions and emotions traps you in a universe
where reflection and fear coexist.
David De Graef’s world is definitely strange. It’s a visionary
universe, which he handles with both tenderness and
violence. This self-taught artist joins power with finesse
to reflect upon our joys and discomfort. He plays with
contrasts to expose scenes of loss and resurrection. The
phantasms of this artist portray mankind’s walk through
love and hatred, faith and lies, hope and disillusion.
His inspiration springs from physical and mental decay,
but is always put in perspective by a strong sense of
humour and optimism.
Through his works, David De Graef has developed a
pictorial philosophy that escapes rational explanation
or narrow classification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because of his use of photohraphy as a base for a large part of
his graphic designs. Charles Hieronimus is known as detailed
artisan that manufactured infographic images, carefully
prepared and thought as paintings proceeded by a draft.
This mental work allows the artist to send out a message,
a personal thought about all the big challenges of our time.
‘Unconscious interventions of a human being into a natural
balance, in the purpose of satisfying all his own needs and
caprices are the starting point of my works.‘ Another side of
his artwork is strictly photographic, namely photographs
made in studio without any digital retouching. Everything
happened during the shooting. This choice allows him to
capture a glimpse nearly imperceptible to the naked eye, so
quick than the brain is incapable to notice it. “It is possible
to make pictures from ordinary things, small details of daily
life. Materials which everybody uses everyday: water, oil,
painting, petroleum or dirt, metal, grass… From mixing all
these liquid or solid materials, which attract or repel each
other, will gush unions or explosions captured by the camera
to reveal its forceful lines.“",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2016,event,Art Exhibition,,Pieter Pauwel Gallery,"Michel, Barthelemy",,,,"Michel Barthélemy is born in 1943 in a small town located
in Belgian Lorraine. He teached plastic arts during
thirty-five years in Arlon, in the south of Belgium. His
first paintings were already a part of the fantastic realism
movement, an inner need from what some abstract and
expressionist experiments have failed to distract him. His
artworks are realistic in a way that it is based on an evocation
of objective reality. Every single staged element
might be easily identified. However, as we travel, we will
not be able to meet these places, in the streets, nor some
of these characters. Nonetheless all of this really exists,
not in the world of our ordinary perceptions, but in this
inwardness where the feeling takes advantage of the
the perceived. We are in a fantastic universe, both familiar
and strange. This trend is wearing in his work two
complementary aspects which appear one by landscape,
the other by portrait. By Landscape, it demonstrates his
delight about the constant power of creation of nature.
It feels mostly attracted to places which are open to immensity,
which “remind to man his verticality”. Portraits
are sarcastic when they are staging proud characters and
they become suddenly tender in front of human being
who shares a common passion for their artwork.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
