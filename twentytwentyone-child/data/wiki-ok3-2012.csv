holiday in Naples, the city where they first met
and fell in love, along with their 10 year old son Jake.
While they are quarrelling, Jake slips away to a souvenir
stand and becomes fascinated by the numerous figurines
of Pulcinella. When his worried parents find him,
they drag him back to the hotel and send him straight
to bed without dinner. But Jake has stolen a Pulcinella
figurine and when it comes to life, it will take us on
a dreamlike journey between reality and imagination.
A delicious little extra to open the Bifff in style: a short
feature of the wonderful, the unique, the unequalled
Terry Gilliam. The Wholly Family is vintage Gilliam, a
magical exploration of Naples like you’ve never seen it
before, stuffed with images and scenes that could only
come from the wicked mind of the director of Brazil,
12 Monkeys and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.
The Wholly Family won the Award for Best Short Feature
at the 2011 European Film Awards."

a remote pond under the full moon. When he
reels in a big catch, he’s amazed to see that it’s not
a fish but a young woman. She begins to talk to him
about his lost daughter. The woman is a shaman who
mediates between the worlds of the living and the dead.
There are not many 30 minutes films that get that much
media attention as Night Fishing. It makes sense if you
know we’re talking about Chan-wook “Old Boy” Park,
who shot the film together with his brother Chan-kyong
Park for 130,000 dollar on an iPhone 4. They put lenses
on the phones and had some intensive postproduction
done on the images. The result, awarded with a Golden
Bear at the 2011 Berlinale, is a visually rich and intriguing
addition to Park’s body of work. With a soundtrack
by UhUhBoo Project, also responsible for the score for
Park’s Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance."

murdered in 19th century Baltimore, Detective
Emmett Fields makes a startling discovery: the crime
resembles a fictional murder described in gory detail
in the local newspaper; part of a collection of stories
penned by struggling writer and social pariah Edgar
Allan Poe. But even as Poe is questioned by police,
another grisly murder occurs, also inspired by a popular
Poe story. Realizing a serial killer is on the loose using
Poe’s writings as the backdrop for his bloody rampage,
Fields enlists the author’s help in stopping the attacks.
But when it appears someone close to Poe may become
the murderer’s next victim, the stakes become even
higher and the inventor of the detective story calls on
his own powers of deduction to try to solve the case
before it’s too late.
James McTeigue started in Hollywood as a second assistant
director on films like Dark City, and made a name
for himself as the first assistant director on The Matrix
films. He famously took the reigns from The Wachowski
Brothers, directing the big screen adaptation of Alan
Moore’s comic book V For Vendetta, our closing film
of 2006. Now he’s back with this gritty thriller about
the final five mysterious days of Edgar Allan Poe’s life,
starring John Cusack ( Being John Malkovich ) as the
legendary horror writer and Luke Evans ( Immortals )
as Emmett Fields. Also starring are Alice Eve ( Sex and
the City 2 ), Brendan Gleeson ( In Bruges ) and Oliver
Jackson-Cohen ( Faster )."

and they are strong. But they are primarily
perfect stereotypes for a horror film. Consider this: the
athlete with a jaw as square as a drawer, the blonde
who is always looking for a neuron to keep her other
one company, the token Afro-American who’s tired of
getting butchered first, the comical virgin beauty ( but
only from the inside ). In short, everything you haven’t
seen before. And of course, they go on a weekend trip
to a remote cabin. It could just as easily be built on an
ancient Indian burial site and marked by Satanic symbols
painted with goat blood. In short, everything you’ve
never seen before. Now, do you think you’ve seen this
story before ? Come and see. When we say it’s going
to be a completely new ballgame, we’re not kidding.
Here it is, finally, just for you, one of the most anticipated
movies of the year! Just as Scream came and
threw a stone into the pond of sarcastic slasher movie
caricatures, Cabin in the Woods is about to repeat this
15 years later. Written and produced by Joss Whedon
( The Avengers, Buffy The Vampire Slayer ), directed by
Drew Goddard ( Cloverfield ), lit by Peter Deming ( Mulholland
Drive, Scream 4 ) and interpreted by, among
others, Chris Hemsworth ( Star Trek, Thor ), this is the
film that will turn the genre upside down and inside out."

Florence Cathcart is Engeland’s most notorious
ghostbuster. No spiritist séance or fairy
sighting is safe from her skeptic mind. Having lost her
beloved in the trenches of World War One, Florence is
driven by the desire to unmask those who try to exploit
the sorrow of those who are grieving for their dead.
She’s approached by teacher Robert Mallory, who asks
her to visit his boarding school in the country. The boys
are being frightened by a child ghost. Florence decides
to help Mallory and travels to the school, which turns out
to be a huge manor where, according to local rumors, a
murder took place some years ago. While investigating,
Florence starts to suspect that for the very first time in
her career, something supernatural seems to be afoot.
She’s forced to let go of her skepticism when she’s
confronted by her own past.
The Awakening, the long feature debut of Nick Murphy, is
a rock solid ghost story that can stand up to classics such
as The Others and The Orphanage. Murphy co-wrote the
script with genre-veteran Stephen Volk ( The Kiss, Gothic,
The Guardian ) and adds lots of emotional depth to his
story, along with some nice plot twist and turns and many
spine chilling moments. As can be expected from an English
quality production, the cast delivers some excellent
performances. Rebecca Hall ( The Prestige, The Town ) is
ghost debunker Florence Cathcart. Dominic West ( 300,
John Carter ) plays Robert Mallory. And Imelda Staunton
( Vera Drake, Harry Potter ) is Maud Hill, the housekeeper
of the boarding school."

Rob decide to gain some extra pocket money
during the Christmas Holidays by playing lab rabbits for
a new drug. Rob is a bit hesitant, but Greg manages
to convince him. What could go wrong? It’s just a new
anti-allergic from pharmaceutical giant Ravexin. But if
that were true, there would not be a movie, of course. A
few days after they’ve joined the rest of the participants
at a remote hospital, Greg already regrets his decision.
The procedures are quite weird, the continuous tapping
of blood extremely painful and nobody seems to care
for the decayed state of facility. The patients arrive in a
state of mental degradation, coupled with a heightened
sense of invincibility. Greg discovers that the drug is
capable of regenerating human tissue, with as nasty
side effect the loss of any moral or ethical scruples. But
why is he the only one who realizes this?
Bloodwork is an intriguing horror thriller by Eric Wostenberg,
who got noticed in 2005 with his science fiction
musical Sacrifice. The lead is taken care of by young
Travis Van Winkle ( Transformers, Friday The 13th ).
His opponent is none other than scifi über-babe Tricia
Helfer ( Battlestar Galactica’s Number 6 ). Veteran Eric
Roberts ( The Dark Knight, The Expendables ), Mircea
Monroe ( Growth, Tekken ) and Rick Young ( Beowulf )
also join the party."

to the mysterious music coming out of a crystal
radio given to her by her father before he died. One day,
while walking home, she’s attacked by a monster. From
out of nowhere, a strange boy comes to the rescue. His
name is Shun and he claims to be from Agartha, a world
in a parallel universe. They quickly bond, but then Shun
disappears. Asuna longs to see her friend again. She
gets help from her teacher, Ryuji Morisaki. The man
has been searching for Agartha for years, because he
believes it’s the place his wife went to when she died.
Others are also looking for this mystical world, but their
intentions are far from peaceful.
The third film from director Makoto Shinkai, already
being seen as the next Hayao Miyazaki because of acclaimed
anime’s such as The Place Promised in Our
Early Days and 5 Centimeters Per Second, is nothing
less but a visual masterpiece. Agartha’s landscapes
look like richly detailed, beautifully colored impressionistic
paintings. Children Who Chase Lost Voices From
Deep Below is inspired by the Japanese myth of Izanami
and Izanagi, an Asian version of the story of Orpheus
and Eurydice, in which Izanagi travels to Yomi, the underworld,
to bring back his beloved from the death. This
year’s essential rendezvous for anime lovers !"

inhabitants start to emerge. The meat
industry is run by werewolves. Vampires manage the
nightclubs and zombies go looking for fresh limbs in the
“body shop”. The balance between these creatures is
extremely fragile, especially since paranormal investigator
Dylan Dog stopped mediating between them after
the love of his life got murdered. It’s only a matter of
time before things will explode. The fuse is lit when a
werewolf kills a mysterious collector of magical objects.
The beautiful daughter of the victim manages to
persuade Dylan Dog to get back into the fray. Together
with his loyal zombie assistant Marcus, he explores New
Orleans supernatural underbelly. They discover a plot
that threatens to destroy the entire city.
Kevin Munroe, responsible for the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles reboot from 2007, presents us with a very tasty
mix of film noir, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Chinatown
and Hellboy, based on the celebrated Italian comic strip
by Tiziano Sclavi. Whether Dylan Dog : Dead of Night
will also become a cult classic like Michele Soavi’s
memorable Cemetery Man ( BIFFF 1995 ), starring Rupert
Everett, remains to be seen. But this crowd pleaser
has a few aces up its sleeve, like Brandon “Superman”
Routh as our favourite supernatural detective and Sam
Huntington ( Fanboys ), Peter Stormare ( The Big Lebowski,
Armageddon ) and Taye Diggs ( The Way of the
Gun, Equilibrium ) in some wonderful supporting roles."

without knowing where he is or how he got
there. Its beautiful inhabitant is called Julia and hasn’t a
clue either about what happened last night. After a few
uncomfortable moments, Julia wants to leave but then
something unexpected catches their attention. There
seems to be nobody outside on the streets and above
the city floats a giant spaceship. All communication
seems to be cut off, with the exception of the radio,
which transmits that everybody has skipped town while
they were in their drunken slumber. Yet they’re not the
last ones left, as Julia’s creepy neighbor joins them. And
he’s clearly not happy about Julio’s presence. Things
get even more complicated when Julia’s boyfriend also
shows up. Can Julio and Julia hide their “probable”
night of passion while at the same time dealing with
the prospect of an alien invasion ?
Nacho Vigalondo’s long feature debut, the original and
innovative Time Crimes, left quite an impression at the
BIFFF in 2008. It’s successor, Extraterrestrial, is an
entirely different kind of movie. It’s a charming romantic
comedy against the background of an alien invasion.
And, contrary to what you might expect, it’s not the
extraterrestrial visitors who are stealing the show, but
the human drama that takes place in one small flat,
while the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Starring
Carlos Areces, the sad clown from Alex de la Iglesia’s A
Sad Trumpet Ballad, as Julia’s stalking neighbor Angel."

During the day, they run the reconstructed inn, while
during the night they search for treasure. The Dragon
Inn is the gateway to a lost city, buried under the desert

the city and that moment is soon approaching. Then a
pregnant imperial concubine and Wen, the mysterious

eunuch Yu and his Imperial Brigade of Assassins want
the girl back. And the disgraced general Zhao wants to
finish off Yu and restore peace and justice in the empire.
With the storm looming over the horizon, everything is

production in 3D ( leading the Asian Film Awards with 7
nominations ) than legendary producer and director Tsui

Moreover, The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate marks the

George, Max and Ricky are
musicians in a rock band, hoping for the big
breakthrough. As their guitar riffs are not going to pay
the rent, they are forced to take on an additional job
as cooks in the kitchen of a high-security psychiatric
asylum. It doesn’t matter that the place looks like a Nazi
bunker in the middle of nowhere. As long as the pay is
good and the risks are low. Employees don’t have any
physical contact with the inmates. However, they’ll soon
find out that there’s no such thing as a zero risk job.
When a storm knocks out the entire power grid, all those

George, Max and Ricky have no other choice but to play
a deadly game of hide and seek till help arrives. If it will
ever arrive at all...
The Incident, directed by Alexandre Courtes ( responsible
for videoclips of The White Stripes, U2 and Jamiroquai
), takes the prison riot movie to a whole new and
intensly scary level. Its première caused quite a fuss
when two members of the audience fainted during its
screening at the Torronto International Film Festival and
had to be escorted out by medics. It’s an esthetically
impeccable horror shocker, edited by Baxter ( The Hills

If you want to know what it feels like to be
locked in with a bunch of dangerous psychopaths in an

1945 with a shot in a bunker under the ruins
of Berlin, are in for a nasty surprise. The secret space
program of the Nazi’s really existed ! The evil bastards
fled to the dark city of the moon, where they quickly
started to multiply and come up with cunning plans for
the creation of the Fourth Reich. This faithful moment
seems to have arrived in 2018, when an Afro-American
astronaut sets foot on the moon. This publicity stunt of
the American government is interpreted by the moon
nazi’s as a prelude to invasion. When they get their first
taste of 21st century technology, they realize it’s just
what they need to launch their attack. Two courageous
volunteers are sent back to Earth to get the goods. But
the American president, who looks suspiciously like
Sarah Palin, is too hot to handle without swastika’s.
Iron Sky: a brilliant idea, partly financed by crowd
funding and elaborated with tons of love for B-movies,
comic-strips and politically incorrect humor. The Finnish
gang responsible for popular Star Trek internet spoofs
such as Star Wreck : In The Pirkinning, dedicated five
years of their life to Iron Sky. What started as an obscure
fan project, turned into a worldwide sensation. After the
world premiere at Berlin, the Finnish moon nazi’s continue
their advance at the BIFFF, led by moon führer Udo
Kier ( Andy Warhol’s Dracula, Shadow of the Vampire )
and his acolytes Julia Dietze ( 205 - Room of Fear ) and

life without making any waves. When Cuba is
hit by a zombie plague, he considers it as just another
tough time to get through. Together with some friends,
he starts a zombie extermination business. At Juan of
the Dead, you pay by the head and business is booming.
But when the “dissidents plague”, as the authorities
prefer to call it, can no longer be controlled and the
number of zombies starts to overshadow the number
of clients, it’s time to pack up shop and get the hell out
of Havana. But there’s nowhere left to run. The undead
are everywhere.
How did they manage to pull it off ? A zombie comedy
in, of all places, Cuba and with a title that invites comparison
to one of the classics in the genre. The reason
why you’re able to see Alejandro Brugues’ debut feature
at the BIFFF, is – of course – because it not only stands
up besides “Shaun”, but also because Juan of the Dead
is as Cuban as a Mojito or a Cohiba. There’s more than
enough blood, guts, gore, black humor and sex to please
the spoiled BIFFF audience. The special effects, the
photography and the script are first rate. The movie
also doesn’t shy away from criticizing the Cuba of the
Castro’s and showing the hard daily reality of one of
the last Communist strongholds on the planet. Juan of
the Dead is a zombie movie with a heart, a heart that
is crushed to bits by a Cadillac with a Lada engine on
the Malecon, Havana’s seaside promenade."

murders and molestations at every street corner;
the future looks as bright as Darth Veder’s boxer

created the Fort Knox of high security prisons: an impregnable
fortress for the worst villains of humanity. A
riot later, the high security standards are quickly revised
upwards, while the concerns for the unfortunate hostages
climb, including young psychologist Emily Warnock.
To put all these beasts back in their cages, the
white collars can only count on Snow, a loose cannon
with a big mouth on trial for a crime he didn’t commit.
After lots of bare-fisted convincing, they are finally
ready to tell him the painful truth. Emilie Warnock is
the daughter of the American President and the highsecurity
prison is located in space.
Lock-out, Europacorp’s new production, co-written and
produced by Luc Besson, unravels the sci-fi codes by
focusing on an anti-hero who talks in gritty punch lines.
The script is like a crossing between Fortress and Cell

Kick-Ass and Super proved that superheroes can be
as normal and as crazy as you and me. With Mr & Mrs

ends and he finds himself back in the desert, with no

Pig is an intriguing mystery thriller with sci-fi elements
by Henry Barrial. The comparison to Christopher Nolan’s
Memento seems logical, but while that classic dealt
with how memory influences our perception of reality,
Pig focuses on identity and how our memories shape
and deform our self-image. Barrial found the idea for Pig
when he read about the ordeal of a German of Lebanese
origin who was kidnapped by the CIA on suspicion of
terrorism. The innocent man spent six month in captivity
in Albania, without knowing where he was or understanding
the language that was spoken around him.
When he returned, he found out that everybody thought
he was dead and he was forced to start his life from
zero. Or how reality keeps inspiring the weirdest and
most original creations of the 7th Art."

unknown, is a courier who crosses the demarcation
line between the two Koreas, delivering everything
from video games and letters to refugees between
separated families in the two countries. One day he is
commissioned to smuggle the lover of a high profile
North Korean defector to the South. When something
starts to bloom between Poongsan and the woman, the
situation quickly escalates, even causing a stir on the
governmental level.
Poongsan presents us with a cynical look at the complicated
relationship between North and South Korea.
The movie is intense from the start, with its mix of love,
hope, loyalty, betrayal, cruelty and violence. It’s directed
by Juhn Jai, but the door to international audiences
is opened by the name of its acclaimed producer and
scriptwriter Ki-duk Kim ( The Isle ). Juhn Jai, who has
worked as an assistant director for Kim, focuses on
the physical instincts of his characters and does that
in a very visual way. So expect some gruesome torture
scenes ! Poongsan tackles the thorny issue of no-man’s
land separating the two Koreas with the violence and
the poetic flavor of a tragic romance that characterizes
the Korean cinema in general and Kim Ki-duk in particular.
This electrifying political romance-thriller will keep
you on your toes from the beginning until the very end."

Argentina suffers from the yoke of a
giant corporation who has the monopoly of
the water supply. One evening, Martinez, a regular Joe
from a poor neighborhood, looses his job as a garbage
man. When he goes to pee in a public toilet, he
meets a strange man who bestows a unique gift upon
him. Every time Martinez grabs his balls and shouts
“Zenitram”, he gets supernatural powers. And this is
how the first Argentinean superhero came to be, albeit
one who’s afraid of flying. Martinez uses his powers to
get the tabs flowing. The people love him, the media
can’t get enough of him and the government… appoints
him minister of extraordinary affairs and buries
him in bureaucracy. Zenitram can’t take it anymore. He
gets addicted to cocaine and immortally embarrasses
himself during the National Holiday. There’s only one
way out: rehab in the Miami hospital for superheroes.
When the love of his life falls into the hands of the
Machiavellian water tycoon, Zenitram seizes this last
chance for redemption.
Zenitram is a peculiar little beast at the BIFFF : an Argentinean
political satire disguised as a superhero epic.
Director Luis Barone certainly knows what he’s talking
about, having done extensive “fieldwork” while being
employed at the cultural departments of provincial and
national ministries. Luckily you don’t have to know anything
about Argentinean politics to enjoy Zenitram. Big
bad multinationals, suffocating bureaucracies, human
weakness and vanity are universal and at least this film
offers hope for salvation, but then served with a solid
portion of irony."

“Saw on a Plane” is what you might think if you’ve

Young British director Carl Tibbets delivers an impressive

creates a disturbing and confined universe where you’ll
wonder until the very end if we’re seeing a glimpse of
a world shattering event or if it’s all the ramblings of a
deranged mind. Everything depends on the chemistry
between the protagonist and for that he could count

a situation he can’t control, he throws it in the face of

The Sandman is a deliciously surreal comedy from
Swiss director Peter Luisi that already won 14 movie
awards. Its title doesn’t only refer to the man of sand
that the main character is slowly becoming, but also
to the mythical Sandman of the fairytales. With lots

troubled past. Meanwhile, in a cabin on a nearby hill,
three lonely and horny farmers are dabbling with the

their every need. Once made flesh, this sexy monster is
abused in all orifices by her creators. But it doesn’t take
long before she turns against them and goes medieval
on the farmers. Back in the village, Reusch discovers
a disturbing connection between his protégé and Sennentuntschi.
Sennentuntschi : Curse of the Alps is Switzerland’s first
big budget horror film. This impressive and stylish debut
feature by Michael Steiner is partly a murder mystery
and partly a macabre fairy tale. The story stays exciting
until the end and is a joy for the eye to see thanks to
cameraman Pascal Walder’s images of wide, rugged
landscapes filled with hidden menace. The performance

parent’s existence. He spends his life dreaming
of brave knights and their heroic deeds, instead of
getting involved in the family business or finding a wife.
One day he decides to leave the house and become
a wandering knight in search of injustice. After Tang
pays an old beggar on a mountain top to give him a
beating that will “unlock” his magical powers, he takes
up arms against a gang of bandits that are kidnapping
the beautiful farmers daughter Cuihua. Tang even succeeds,
albeit with more luck than prowess, to drive
them off. This gets him his Sancho Panzo, pig farmer
Sang Qui, and a quest : liberating Ciuhua, whom he
imagines to be a noble princess. Luck and coincidence
remain on Tang’s side and by the time he reaches the
city where Ciuhua is being held in the harem of a mob
boss, his reputation has swollen to legendary proportions.
But how long will this last ?
In this fantastic comedy, Cervantes’ legendary creation
gets a makeover Asian style. And that’s not so strange
as it seems. The medieval knight’s code is quite alike
to the warrior ethic of the wu xia films. Lead actor Guo
Tao manages to combine the two cultures through his
entertaining interpretation, an endearing mix of chivalrous
innocence and outright stupidity. Director Ah Gan
adds some gravity defying battles in 3D and comic relief
to the cocktail. In short, spectacular eye-candy for the
entire family."

Kevin Sorbo is usually seen in heroic parts such as

Luckily, there’s a farm nearby. And that’s, of course,

You might think that One Way Trip 3D is just another one
of those films about a bunch of young willing victims
partying in the woods and falling prey to a bunch of
psychopaths with pointy things in their hands. And with
3D you’d be expecting knifes and blood flying out of the

slasher fest. Director Markus Welter has managed to
avoid the many traps and clichés of the genre, because
the trip in the title refers to the psychedelic state of mind

Philippine director Yam Laranas and the BIFFF go way

2012,edition,"Edito, Edito 2012",,Edito 2012,,,,,"In somewhat less refined language, we would
really love to say: what the f***, thirty years!
Who could have thought that, in 1983 during
the very first edition of the B.I.F.F.T S.F.F. – the
Brussels International Festival of Fantasy,
Thriller & Science Fiction Film ( luckily we could
switch to B.I.F.F.F. a bit later ) at the projection
of Valeri Rubinchik’s The Savage Hunt of King
Stakh – this adventure would continue to the next
millennium ?
And here we are then in 2012: 15.000 reviewed
films ( which could be translated into four entire
years of our life watching the silver screen or
17.500 successive viewings of The Exorcist ),
2.000 guests and 2 million spectators later!
So what the f***, indeed !
And to think that fantastic film was then
considered to be almost dead, slowly
extinguishing between the burning embers of the
Hammer horror heritage, Roger Corman, Lucio
Fulci, Mario Bava and company… All we were
good for was to give the last rites and accompany
Fantastic Film to its grave. But the most
tenacious critics oversaw one tiny detail. The
genre is simply timeless, because it is inherent to
mankind: the monster in the closet, nightmares,
fairytales, dreams… What’s more natural than
the supernatural ?
So we persisted. We fought tooth, nail and claw
to get from there to here. We survived the end
of the Cold War with Anthony Perkins, Ringo
Starr, James Coburn and Christopher Lee. We
negotiated with flourishing companies such as
Sabena that now no longer exist. We helped
young and promising directors into the saddle,
who are now at the summit of their career
( Peter Jackson, David Cronenberg and Shinya
Tsukamoto, to name just a few ). We exhausted
ourselves to give you world premières. And all
these years of endurance and passion have paid
off. The BIFFF is now recognized as one of the
most important genre film festivals in the world.
Our prestigious guests do not stop proclaiming
that we’re “often imitated, but rarely equaled”,
just like the image of our surrealist Belgium. And
the spearhead of the Festival, the magic which
gives us the strength and the courage to keep on
Biff fing year after year… is YOU : our loyal and
loudly enthusiast audience, famous throughout
the entire galaxy. We take advantage of this
opportunity to say it out loud: a thousand Thank
You’s to you all… Damn, we had promised not to
become sentimental. Must be old age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

17 editions of our Workshop Fantastic Brussels. For
17 years now, we’ve been trying to contaminate our
future filmmakers with the fantastic film virus. Under
the supervision of old and young genre masters such
as Freddie Francis, Lewis Gilbert, Stuart Gordon, Nick
Willing and Bernard Rose, 16 generations of film
students have learned how to decapitate mummies, fix
a vampire’s dentures or simulate the end of the world
on a micro-budget. Directors such as Pieter Van Hees
( Left Bank ), Hans Van Nuffel ( Oxygen ) and Gust Van
Den Berghe ( Blue Bird ) set their very first steps at the
BIFFF’s workshop. You’ll have the opportunity to see their
fantastic shorts in this special retrospective featuring the
best from 16 years Fantastic Brussels !                                                       Not all of us are born as movie buffs. And even
if a spontaneous mutation would occur during
adolescence, you still need to pass one crucial stage
before becoming a professional director: learning
how to make movies ! That’s why, for 17 years now,
the BIFFF organises the Workshop “Fantastic
Brussels”. The students of two Brussels’ film schools,
the RITS and the INSAS, write, prep, shoot and edit
two fantastic shorts under the supervision of an
experienced foreign filmmaker.
The big boss of this 17th edition is Paco Cabezas, a
Spanish director and screenwriter who directed The
Appeared ( BIFFF 2008 ) and Neon Flesh ( BIFFF 2011 )
and scripted Spanish Movie and Sexykiller ( Audience
Award BIFFF 2009 ). At the moment, Paco’s working
on his third long feature Mr Right, written by Max
Landis, son of our 2011 Knight in the Order of the
Raven : John Landis.
The two scripts that were selected for this year are:
• Rated R by Dimitri Devroe
• Two Clowns by Pieter Janssens
Practically speaking : the shooting took place from
19 till 22 March, followed immediately by editing and
postproduction till 29 March.
The official presentation of the two shorts will take
place on the ominous date of Friday the 13th of April,
during the Belgian Fantastic Film Day in the presence
of Paco Cabezas.
Besides the satisfaction of a job well done, one lucky
student will receive the Eye-Lite Award, consisting
of 2500 Euro worth of lighting equipment for the
winner’s next project. The jury will also hand out two
motivational awards to students who distinguished
themselves above and beyond duty during the entire
production process.
Finally, let’s not forget that this workshop could not
exist without the support of the Flemish Community
Commission of the Brussels Capital Region,
Jean-Pierre Finotto’s Make-Up School, Eye-Lite,
ES Broadcast & Media, TV Connections and CGI
Trainer.

2012,event,"Focus, Hong-Kong Focus",,Hong-Kong Focus,,,,,"Hong Kong, which means “perfumed harbour” in
Cantonese, is not only one of the financial and economic
powerhouses of the world economy. At the simple
evocation of its name, we start dreaming of exotic
adventures on faraway seas. We fondly remember the
numerous classics from the Shaw Brothers, The Way
of the Dragon ( 1972 ) where Chuck Norris got his ass
kicked for the last time ( by Bruce Lee ), or even cult films
which led us to discover Jackie Chan and his partner
Sammo Hung.
For decades, Hong Kong was the third major film
producer behind Hollywood and Bollywood, revealing to
the audience major stars such as Chow Yun-Fat, John
Woo, Wong Kar-Wai, Tsui Hark, Stephen Chow and
those who’ll honour us this year by coming to Brussels :
Gordon Chan, Tony Ching and Benny Chan!
If you know that Hong Kong is one of the most populated
territories in the world with more than 7 million
inhabitants for 1092 km², roughly the size of Walloon
Brabant, you quickly realize that it means a lot of genius
per square meter ! And that’s exactly why the BIFFF
felt compelled to pay a tribute to this dynamic Asian
peninsula with this year’s Focus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2012,event,"Focus, Danish Focus",,Danish Focus,,,,,"To honour the Danish presidency of the Council of the
European Union, the BIFFF – in collaboration with the
Danish Film Institute, the Danish Cultural Institute-
Benelux and the Danish Presidency of the European
Union – organises a reception in order to greet in our
very own special way our friends from the north !
Denmark, the Northern European peninsula that tickles
the south of Sweden, is known for many reasons :
Bluetooth comes from King Harald “the blue tooth”
because of his rotten teeth, who unified the country in the
10th Century and whom Hamlet mocked so brilliantly with
his “there’s something rotten...”. Carlsberg is probably the
best beer in the world ( with the exception of all Belgian
ones, of course ! ). Caroline Wozniacki is part of the world’s
tennis top 3 ( even if Kim Clijsters gave her a beating at the
Australian Open ). And when it comes to culture, they have
nothing to be ashamed of : from Hans Christian Andersen
to Metallica’s drummer Lars Ullrich ; they can definitely
beat themselves on the chest !
So what should we say then about their cinema, for
which the BIFFF has a particular fondness ?
Anders Thomas Jensen plundered our award’s chest in
2006 with Adam’s Apple by winning the Golden Raven,
the Silver Méliès and the Audience Award and snatched
away the Méliès in 2004 with The Green Butchers.
Ole Bornedal left with the Audience Award in 1995
for Nightwatch and came back in 2010 with Deliver
Us From Evil, a chilling thriller with a largely deserved
critical success !
In brief, Danish cinema has become a label of quality
and excellence which we will continue to encourage
during this 30th edition with the following screenings :
Beast • ID:A • Ronal The Barbarian.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
