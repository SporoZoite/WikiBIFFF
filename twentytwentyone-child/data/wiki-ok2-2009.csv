from the city and its problems. They can finally do what they want: dad is writing again, while
mom spends her time in the kitchen. As for Coraline, well, she so bored she’s actually counting
raindrops on her windowpane. However, just like any old house worthy of the name, this one
features a secret passage; a tiny little door leading to a parallel world. A world full of laughter
and beautiful colors, where her parents have time to play with her. Of course there are a few
drawbacks. What with everyone having buttons… for eyes ? If she wants to fit in, she’ll have
to button up. Or someone else will.
Just a little reminder for all you Tim Burton-freaks out there: the actual director
of The Nightmare Before Christmas is Henry Selick, one of the few remaining
masters of stop-motion animation, who also delighted us with the beautiful
James and the Giant Peach. Based on Neil Gaiman’s best-seller, Selick’s
new feature takes us once again to a magic universe, brimming with
visual enchantment. The technical tour-de-force – just have a look
at the official website to find out the amount of work it took – is
quickly forgotten as you are reeled in by the sheer beauty of it
all. Coraline is well on its way to rank among the most gorgeous

When he’s got an article to write, he
doesn’t just look up the stuff for a few hours on the net or send a quick mail to some press
attaché. He’s the kind of guy who gets his ass out on the street to investigate. The problem
with being on the street though, is that you end up making friends. In this case Stephen
Collins, the rising star of American politics with a solid reputation of integrity. So when one
of his investigations on the murder of a Congress researcher turns out to put a slur on
Collins and reveals a major political and financial imbroglio, Cal ends up wishing
he was like all his fellow journalists and had only one best friend : Google.
If you happen to be a fan of television series, you’ve probably heard the
title of Kevin Macdonald’s new film before ( we also owe the brilliant
Last King of Scotland to him). Indeed, this feature is based on one of
the BBC’s best mini-series in recent years. Sure, on the big screen
there’s less room for character depth, but the remake manages
to keep all of the intensity which made the original plot such a
hit. Macdonald acknowledges his film is a tribute to political
thrillers from the seventies, such as Three Days of the Condor
and All the President’s Men. Add a star-studded cast ( Ben
Affleck, Russell Crowe, Helen Mirren, … ) and Macdonald has
got himself a winning recipe to play with the big boys."

on. The neighbours are a bunch of weirdoes and the local cop returned so traumatised from
the war in Iraq that she doesn’t even carry a gun anymore. Everything hints to a process of
degeneration. And – would you believe it – Jack blows a fuse. He starts to imagine his wife
walking around, insulting and harassing him. To cut a long story short, Jack decides to do
her in but… she refuses to die.
Blood is going to flow ! Scriptwriter Harry Shannon, a novelist specialized in
horror who has worked on Basic Instinct and Terminator 2, has concocted
a cocktail of black humour and gore with a slight hint of Sam Raimi’s
Evil Dead. Director Yossi Sasson manages to compensate the lack of
budget with an extra amount of enthusiasm. Dead and Gone starts
like a Twin Peak episode but then takes a completely different
and unexpected turn. Is Jack’s wife some sort of monster, is the
shack haunted, has Jack gone mad or is it a mixture of all of
this ? Check out the gory blood-soaked ending for the answer."

cabin floor, the fun is really over. Hordes of Nazi Zombies claw their way out from under the
snow to sink their teeth into our unfortunate heroes.
The US of A used to be the measure for all things gore, slasher or zombie. But
in recent years, “Old Europe” has been successfully nibbling away at this
Yankee supremacy. You can now add another title to the ever increasing
list of European genre killers : Dead Snow ! Tommy Wirkola, notorious
for his Kill Bill parody Kill Buljo, manages to serve us a cocktail in
which the three main ingredients – horny youngsters, undead brain
eaters and lots of snow – have been mixed to perfection. Dead

This species of wasps hatches its eggs inside the body of a caterpillar. The egg becomes
a larva that eats the caterpillar alive from the inside. We can ask ourselves: “Who would want
to be in the place of the caterpillar ?” However, this is about to happen to two quite disparate
couples, two innocent campers and an inmate on the run with his girlfriend. The latter force
their way inside the car of the former, but a tire unfortunately bursts and they get stranded
in an isolated gas station. The reason : the clerk has already served as hors d’oeuvre for a
human scaled ichneumon-like parasite ! Splinter is a film where “being in a character’s skin”
has to be taken literally !
Splinter is the long feature debut of SFX specialist Toby Wilkins, who learned
his job by working with James Cameron ( Ghost Of The Abyss ), Bret Ratner
( Rush Hour II ), Jonathan Demme ( The Manchurian Candidate ) and many
others. According to him “The Splinter isn’t exactly a creature but
rather a substance, which – like the stings of a sea-urchin – pierces
through the skin and does some heavy damage inside. The reason
it works so well on screen is that it’s already scary enough to be
killed by a creature, but not to die and be invaded by something
that takes possession of your body and eats you alive from the
inside is even scarier !”"

husband Robbie to celebrate the New Year. Besides there being a lot of friction between the
two couples, they also have four kids among them and one rebellious adolescent, Casey, who
constantly tries to see how far she can go in driving them insane. It promises to be a memorable
party. As soon as they get out of the car, little Paulie greets his uncle and aunt by vomiting all
over them. Soon everybody starts shouting against one another. But Paulie isn’t just a little
bit carsick. His troubled stomach is one of the symptoms of a frightening virus that soon
spreads among the children. The already not so innocent little angels turn into vicious
little demons. Will there still be anybody alive to welcome the New Year ?
Why are we so afraid of our children ? From Wolf Rilla’s Village of the Damned
and Narciso Ibanez Serrador’s Would You Kill A Child ? to Richard’s
Donner’s The Omen, filmmakers have given us chilling portraits of
little monsters. British director Tom Shankland (Waz) is the latest
in line and his The Children is not only very bloody, but also quite
funny and intelligent. The virus is just a catalyst. The behaviour
of the children is an extreme reflection of all the hatred, envy,
jealousy, backstabbing and violence they witness in the adults
around them."

tutoring at school. They might be smart, but they’re certainly not perfect. We get to know the
docile Inah, the rebellious heartthrob Kang-hyun, Ina’s best friend Myung-ho, the paranoid Hyeyoung,
the hallucinating schizophrenic Jo-beom, the insomniac Dong-hyuk, the shy Jae-wook,
the overly sensitive Suu-jin and their popular teacher Chang-wook. In the middle of class,
Beethoven’s Für Elise suddenly sounds on the speaker system. The television in class shows
images of Hye-young captured in a tank with fast rising water. An unknown voice asks
the solution to an exam question. A wrong answer will cost Hye-young’s life. For
the students, this is the beginning of the most lethal exam of their lives.
If you consider all the horror films taking place there, Korean high schools
must truly be hell on Earth ! What distinguishes Death Bell from all
the others is the originality of the concept : victims with no way out
being forced to solve puzzles and riddles to save themselves. The
debut of video clip maker Chang is visually top class and contains
enough “shocks & gore” to please even the most demanding
genre fan. It won’t be long before an American remake !"

At least he does in cartoons.
Now, what about the Tasmanian tiger ? Is it extinct ? No one can actually prove they have
ever seen one. But now Nina, a rather lively zoology student, has gotten hold of a footprint
found by her sister and decides to set up an expedition to track down the beast. Being an
animal lover and all, little does she care that back in the 19th century some killer broke out
of a local jail and survived by eating his fellow fugitives. Eventually, the guy was hanged for
cannibalism, but he did leave some descendents sharing his delicate culinary tastes and they
still happen to be out there. Nina and her friends are about to find out that the only dying
breed in the region is them !
An adventure that takes place in beautiful wild landscapes and also benefits from
a smart plot is definitively rare. It turns out that not only did the Tasmanian
tiger ( aka the Thylacine, a marsupial resembling a dog with tiger stripes
on its back ) actually existed, but that Alexander Pierce, the cannibal
better known as the Pieman, was also totally real. Unfortunately, the
tiger / dog has become extinct ( the last specimen died in a zoo in
1936 ), but the man-eater, who was executed in 1824, became
a local legend. They even named the Pieman River after him
in the area where the film was shot. Dying Breed is destined
for those who like their meat raw and bloody, even though
Australian director Jody Dwyer says it’s more of a thriller than
a horror and gore flick. Enjoy your meal."

Now that he has
regained his freedom, he moves into his mother’s flat. She passed away while he was in
jail. His neighbour is a cop and a real bastard. He regularly beats up his wife and daughter.
Their screams can be heard through the walls, sometimes waking up Bobby in the middle of
the night. At other times of the day he hears noises of which he’s never able to pinpoint the
source. Slowly, Bobby begins to understand the ordeal of his mother’s final days and why she
locked herself in until the very end. Her fate might also become his.
In 2005 the Philippine atmospheric horror film Sigaw won our 7th Orbit Award. This
recognition was one of the things that allowed its director Yam Laranas to move
to the US, where he got the chance to shoot a remake of his remarkable
debut. We can certify that this American version is even better than the
original. Laranas has not only managed to maintain the meticulously
slow build-up of tension and horror, he has also given more depth to

Masters of horror Wes Craven ( The Hills Have Eyes, Nightmare on Elm Street,

film, the controversial 1972 shocker ( itself a remake of Ingmar
Bergman’s The Virgin Spring ), that launched Craven’s directing career
and influenced decades of horror films to follow. Bringing one of
the most notorious thrillers of all time to a new generation, they
are the producers behind this story that explores how far two
ordinary people will go to exact vengeance on the sociopaths
who harmed their child. Greek director Dennis Iliadis debuted
with Hardcore, a gripping drama about two girls forced into
prostitution. He seems to have been the perfect choice for the

ribbed corduroys, Emil Zatopek’s shorts, thermolactyl undies ( we’re in Sweden, after all ) and
the Engelbert Humperdinck hairdo. That’s too much to bear for one single person and his
fellow students make it known to him every day with some heavy-duty–punches-on-thenose.
But Oskar knows that revenge is a dish that is best served cold, and he hatches
up a plot with the help of this new neighbor Eli, also asocial – she only lives at

Just when we started to believe that fang flicks had definitely passed

emo-kids of Twilight, salvation comes once again from Scandinavia.
Celebrated wherever it was presented ( notably by our colleagues
from Neuchâtel and Sitges where it swiped the Silver and Golden

The Mutant Chronicles, inspired by a primitive pen-and-paper role-playing game first

rapid one-liners and blazing gunfire with one another. Even John
Malcovich makes a short but enigmatic contribution to the mutant

violence are some of the ingredients that will occupy your nightmares for days.
Antti-Jussi Annila ( Helsinki, 1977° ) studied at the Polytechnic of Art and Media in

films. With Sauna he does not shun allusions to 2001 : A Space Odyssey,
Stalker or Gladiator. Echoes to Stanley Kubrick and Andrei Tarkovski

Sexykiller follows in the wake of Alex de la Iglesia’s black comedies, but with a

extra money would be most welcome. Now Hobbs isn’t just a janitor in any ordinary place. He
works for the London Diamond Corporation and he hears a lot of things while sweeping the

Laura to become his accomplice in building up his retirement fund and getting
her a golden parachute ( or should we say diamond parachute ? ).
Demi Moore and Michael Caine definitely are an attractive leading
couple. In addition, we savor the fact that this isn’t Caine’s first
robbery flic and that his best movies date back from the 60ties,
the period in which Flawless is set. Even though this film requires
him to trade his usual elegant suit for an overall, his talent for
portraying slightly cynical men less innocent than they appear,
is once again confirmed. It’s not the first time either that Demi
Moore partners up with Caine. They already starred together
in Blame It On Rio. As an anecdote, Moore found it so difficult
to develop a British accent, that the writers decided to add a
line specifying that she was an American living in London."

Red is an atmospheric psychological thriller based on a story by Stephen

in many ways, Dream represents a turning point in the career

Sherlock Freud again. Harassed by Yukie, a sleepless schoolgirl whose nights are haunted by
a dead fellow student, he becomes intrigued by her dreams; especially as her nightly fits of
madness strangely resemble those that tormented Kyoichi’s mother. Through his enquiry, he
might catch a glimpse of his own fears.
Festival favorite Shinya Tsukamoto scored a hit with “Nightmare Detective” part one. By
respectfully following the requirements of teenage horror, his film was as accessible as it
was frightening. Yet he managed to inject plenty of strangeness and torment into the
feature. Now, freed from the box-office syndrome, Tsukamoto manages to offer
an even richer, more audacious experience. As he focuses more on the inner
demons of his protagonist, he adds a surrealistic coating to the style of
the film, strengthening the beauty and force of his direction."

the gap between image and reality. When the death of a model on the catwalk leads
to a murder investigation, Michelangelo’s interviews become crucial in solving
the crime.
In Rage, acclaimed British filmmaker Sally Potter ( Orlando, The Tango

important than common humanity. We see the entire story through
the eyes of an adolescent, whose only weapons are the tools of
his generation : the internet and a cell phone. This bitterly funny
and absurd comedy was shot in London and New York with just
a green screen as a background for the actors and with Potter

The slow and enigmatic The Stranger, the long feature debut of Finnish helmer Jukka Pekka
Valkeapää, sometimes reminds us of the big tradition of Soviet cinema. It is one of those
movies that captivate the audience by what’s hidden behind the remarkable images
of breathtaking beauty. The same can be said about the soundtrack. It’s used to
transcend the feelings of the characters, which most of the time speak for
themselves. The constant atmosphere of mystery enables the audience
to extrapolate all that is “unspoken” from the simple and sober story.

Cold Prey 2 : It was actually a very close shot. A forest ranger found Jannike severely injured
and half frozen in the middle of the road. He drove her to a hospital where she now recovers
in a bed. The cops are nevertheless suspicious. At first they don’t believe her when she tells
them her harrowing story. But a painstaking excavation reassures them regarding her mental
health. The alleged bodies are found and brought back to the hospital morgue, including the
one of the killer. When Jannike hears about it, she panics and immediately wants to kill him
again. Could she have lost her mind after all ?
The first installment of Cold Prey was one of Norway’s biggest hits in 2006
and its lead actress, Ingrid Borso Berdal, was awarded the “Amanda” ( the
local equivalent of the Oscar ), for best actress. In the lineage of the best
slashers, the film showed a group of youngsters lost in the snow and
finding shelter in what looked at first sight to be an abandoned
hotel. They were confronted be a killer whose trademark was to
throw his victims in a crevasse. At least there they kept their

Stenberg, who – in addition to the original suspense – made

haunted by nightmares of her friend and fellow-survivor Mona crying for help. Unable to get in

she’s told that Mona has moved back to Tyrol. The trail leads to an isolated inn high in the
snow-covered mountains, run by a woman and her three sons. One of them is a sex pervert,
suspected of killing a girl three years ago. No one in their right mind would go near a
place like that, except for Nina.
In 3 Tagen Bist Du Tot was the film that put Austrian genre cinema on the
international map. It was awarded with the Silver Mélies for Best European
Fantastic film at the BIFFF. No wonder this led to a sequel. Dead in
Three Days 2, starring several of the same actors, is a refreshingly
different follow-up that doesn’t try to be a variation on a theme.
It merely induces another kind of suspense. The picture draws
as much tension from the snowy Alps ( and its sudden storms )

Ebensee, while not leaving out the required dose of shocking
images and violence."

Franklyn, the ambitious and audacious long feature debut of young British director Gerald
McMorrow, is a remarkable fusion of dystopian fantasy and social problems such as
schizophrenia, depression, suicide, post-traumatic stress, homelessness and the desperate
longing for love in a cold and heartless society. Meanwhile City is an astounding
creation, as if Terry Gilliam would have designed something between Dark City

to have been an easy step for the two blokes. Humains is very strong
on emphasizing fear ( or even anxiety ) in stead of SFX. So much
the better for the suspense that pours out of every image of this
survival movie “made in France”. Humains benefits from the
sumptuous Swiss scenery, in which we see two newcomers

This plot looks like another hysteric woman / haunted house / catholic guilt triangle

tangling itself up – just as Asian horror before – reproducing the same kind
of plot as if working on an assembly line ? Fortunately our hopes are lifted

The title of this film has several interpretations, because appearances can be
deceiving. This Italian pic starts with a very hectic police operation that
degenerates into total butchery, but then takes on a very different tone.
We are led into a psychological labyrinth out of which there seems
to be no escape. Action and mental tension alternate continuously
in this thriller. Most of the main characters apparently have good

the time they were in love. Ping, Wai’s younger sister, thinks that Wai resembles
more and more the icky creatures of the manga’s she likes reading. From
suspicion to jealousy, they all start frolicking with death.
Directing brothers Danny and Oxide Pang have been busy since
1999, making a name for themselves as the dynamic horror duo
from Hong Kong. This time, Danny is back at the BIFFF with a
story that is more driven by characters than by special effects
or ghostly appearances. You got it : the classic doomed love
triangle. If that doesn’t sound too frightening, think again.
We’re talking about a movie from the Pang’s. In Love With The
Dead succeeds in deeply troubling its audience. It’s a pleasure
for the eyes, with horror always lurking beneath the surface."

of her little girl, the bond between her and her husband has been broken. One morning,
a stranger begs her to legally defend a certain Mona, wrongly accused of having decapitated
her husband. In jail, Mona pretends to know the real murderer : Kandisha. But there’s one
problem. Kandisha is the heroine of a 14 centuries old legend. Even if some say that this
beautiful creature has slaughtered some unfaithful or violent husbands, this argument does
not mean anything in 2009, not even if you’re a brilliant lawyer. But when she begins to
meet a charismatic storyteller and some strange witnesses, Nyla starts to wonder
if there’s isn’t some truth to the legend of Kandisha.
It’s not everyday that we see a Moroccan movie with international
ambition. The film enjoys a big budget, compared with other local
productions, and benefits from an impressive cast, with actors like
Amira Casar ( Anatomie de l’Enfer ), Saïd Taghmaoui ( Wanted ), Hiam
Abbass ( The Visitor ) and David “Kill Bill” Carradine. Without giving
away any spoilers, Kandisha is a very subtle movie. Director
Jérôme Cohen-Olivar could easily have made Kandisha the
monster of a horror flic, with heads flying around. Instead, he
opts for an allegoric story that fuses legend and reality and
has some poignant things to say about the place of women
in Moroccan society."

years old. For Dave, an underwater photographer, they have always been a fascinating
subject. He once hid an engagement ring down there, to be retrieved only when he’d find the
women of his dreams. And eventually he does. As Dave intends to propose to Jing Gao while
diving among the ruins, an accident makes him disappear without a trace. When a headless,
unidentifiable body is found, the desperate Jing Gao enters a world filled with ghosts and
visions of a glass bearing the number 1016. If she wants to get her man back, she sure
as hell will have to go to extremes.
With nearly sixty films as a producer and about forty as a director, it’s safe
to say Tsui Hark has become an Asian cinema legend. John Woo, Chow
Yun-Fat and Jet Lee all partly owe him their careers. Back in the
seventies and eighties, he had a major hand in Hong Kong’s worldwide
filmmaking success, especially on VHS ( his films would rarely be
screened in Western theatres ). A master of kung-fu flicks, yet
perfectly comfortable with comedy or romance, he’s always been
full of surprises. He proves this once again with this strikingly
aesthetic movie, overflowing ( literally ) with breathtaking
underwater shots and brimming with romance. Don’t expect
too much violence: Missing is a dense, romantic ghost story."

through Japan, making its way to the G8 Summit. The prestige of the world leaders is at stake,
so they plan and execute strategic operations such as a missile attack or deadly poisoning.
Needless to say that they all hilariously fail to stop Guilala.
Minoru Kawasaki is a big fan of those “terrifying-giant-cardboard-Godzilla-kinda-monsters”
from the heroic years of Japanese cinema. His latest exploit, an homage to one of the worst
films of the sixties : Monster X From Outer Space, is a horrendously hilarious satire on
international politics. Kawasaki rose to cult fame by making low-budget satire
such as The World Sinks Except Japan ( 2006 ), The Calimari Wrestler ( 2004 )
or Executive Koala ( 2005 ). The monster is voiced by Takeshi Kitano,
something which Asian film aficionados will certainly appreciate."

bus she accepts an offer of help from co-worker Birdie. She can stay at her house, well, at
least at Birdie’s parents’ house. Now, Birdie’s folks are not exactly your average mum and dad.
Their favourite pastime is abducting and torturing people. Upon arrival, Lena is knocked down
and wakes up chained to a bed. In the next room, she hears a woman screaming her lungs
out in pain. Luckily, being Birdie’s friend, Mum is kind enough to offer Lena a place in the
“family”, provided she gives a hand and makes an effort to fit in. After all, you wouldn’t
want to unleash Dad’s terrifying anger.
Sickening and, at times, almost impossible to watch, Mum and Dad is
definitely a tour de force. Steven Sheil’s debut feature film is also the
first of 10 microscopic-budget films from Microwave Productions,
who’ve taken on the challenge of producing fully fledged features
for maximum 100 000 £ ( 120 000 € ). Horror film aficionado Sheil
describes Mum & Dad as “Brutal and perverse. It’s about the
perversity of the family cell... it perniciously distorts something
perfectly normal.” Those who know Perry Benson, who plays
Dad, from his nerdy underdog parts in popular TV-comedies
such as You Rang, M’Lord and Oh, Doctor Beeching are in for
a gruesome surprise."

uncomfortable for the poor guy’s partners. You will laugh your ( dick ) heads off.
Life is unfair ! The star of this delirious parody is Ron Jeremy himself. We’ll enlighten those
who have been living in a monastery for the last three decades. Ron is a round character,
to put it bluntly. He’s overweight, fat, potbellied and hairy, he’s got a mustache and
he’s certainly not a Brad Pitt look alike. Yet, according to AVN Magazine, this
guy has been the nr. 1 porn star of all times. He spends his time shagging
the most alluring chicks. How the heck is it possible ? You may think

in its path, Kainan forms an unlikely alliance with the primitive but fierce warriors. Combining
his advanced technology with ancient Iron Age weapons, the hero leads a desperate attempt
to kill the monster before it destroys them all.
Alien meets Beowulf seems like an improbable combination, but debuting director
Howard McCain, screenwriter of Underworld : Rise of the Lycans and the
upcoming Conan movie, has managed to pull it off. You’ll hugely enjoy seeing
savage, primitive Vikings with swords and axes paired off against an
impressive cgi-creature. But Outlander isn’t just all action and bloody
mayhem. As the story develops, we find out that our hero Kainan,
played by James “The Passion of the Christ” Caviezel has a dark
side and the “monster” has its reasons to be so pissed off. You
can also count on some solid performances by John Hurt ( The
Elephant Man, 1984 ) as an aging Viking king, Sophia Myles
( Underworld, Tristan + Isolde ) as his free spirited daughter

It doesn’t make sense trying to compare Passengers with any other “dramatic survivor

beguiling characters. There’s no horror but lots of psychological tension
and an ending that will delight fans of…no, telling would be spoiling.

has a grudge to settle with the pirates and is ready to do those beautiful princesses a favour.
Queens of Langkasuka is the most expensive Thai film ever made and it oozes from every

fill up the screen from start to finish. The film has the same nostalgic charm of classics
such as Sinbad the Sailor and director Nonzee Nimibutr ( Nang Nak ) manages to keep

on Earth. In the 80ties, the Tamil country certainly needed an intrepid cowboy who could draw a
pistol as easily as he could utter a chilling phrase. As for his looks, it would immediately prompt
an epileptic fit from the Bee-Gees. Nevertheless, Quick Gun is God’s little protégé. When he gets
ambushed and killed by his archenemy Rice Plate Reddy, who wants to turn every vegetarian
into carnivores, The Supreme Being gives him a second chance and reincarnates him... but
15 years later in Modern Mumbai. Quick Gun takes up the battle again with Reddy, who has
become a fast food tycoon.
Quick Murugan is an outright TV star in Southern India, starring in countless
sequels and ads. He’s more of an Austin Powers type of character than a Man
without a Name. His first appearance on the big screen is an outrageous
and colourful comedy stuffed with references to western cinema.
For those of you who might be allergic to “video-clip-culture”, it’s
worth noting that Tollywood cinema ( T stands for the Indian state
of Tamil Nadu ) has nothing to do with its Bombay relative. Quick

factory, earning dollars by connecting his body to the net. This controls a worker drone
in America, while he never physically crosses the border.
Alfonso Cuaron managed to give sense to the word “refugee” in Children
of Men. His compatriot Alex Rivera does the same with globalization in
this low-budget sci-fi flic. The simple plot – a rarity for the genre –
draws attention to issues such as privatization of essential goods,
indifference to distant misery and the merchandizing of private
life. Even if we sense the lack of budget, we feel that Rivera
firmly believes in his story. He offers us an excellent piece of
entertainment while at the same time delivering a powerful
political message."

The next on their list is Vulcan, where Kirk’s new colleague, Spock, happens to originate
from. Strangely the prospect of seeing his entire race smashed to smithereens
doesn’t even make him raise an eyebrow.
All hail JJ Abrams, new lord of the geeks, who decided to take over the Star
Trek franchise and give it a good trashing! Let’s face it, no matter how much
we love Star Trek, no matter how worried the Trekkies may be about their
holy grail, the universe created by Gene Roddenberry was slowly but
surely losing steam. The creator of Lost and Alias, who admitted he’s
not particularly a fan of the series, went for a total reset of Star Trek
by going back all the way to the birth of the Starship Enterprise, at
a time when the crew members were barely getting to know each
other. This allowed Abrams to reshape the characters, giving them
a depth we hadn’t seen in a long time. Thanks to that, Abrams

companions are still the Lords of the Park.
We know, it’s hard to admit but one of the qualities Americans don’t lack is their sense
of politically incorrectness when they portray their hicks. It goes without saying that vast
open spaces can embolden a person. Trailer Park of Terror aims high with its gallery of
paunchy, violent, vulgar, coarse, sexually obsessed yokels. They don’t eat children, but
they are supremely creative when it comes to butchering young nerds. Stephen

It’s very rare that Hollywood has managed to get it right when it comes to remaking an Asian
horror hit. The Uninvited, based upon our Silver Raven 2004, Ji-woon Kim’s A Tale
of Two Sisters, is one of these exceptions. The distressing atmosphere of the
original has often been compared to The Ring, a very solid reference indeed.

become a little bit nostalgic about the Festival.
And the latest news ; that’s Danny Boyle and his eight
Oscars.
It’s been a long time that we know, follow and
appreciate Danny Boyle.
Not a lot of people know about that.
Two years ago, we opened the first BIFFF at
Tour & Taxis with Sunshine.
It was an Opening Night to remember, but not a lot of
people know about that.
Six years ago we opened the BIFFF with 28 Days Later.
Danny Boyle was there, but not a lot of people know
about that.
And in 1995 we presented his very first long feature,
a dark, little gem called Shallow Grave.
And Danny Boyle stood there, smiling on our stage.
We’re certain that hardly anybody knows about that.
Danny Boyle finally got the recognition he deserved.
We’re not saying that we’ve discovered him.
But we already saw his talent from the start.
The audience of the BIFFF knew Danny Boyle long
before The Beach or Slumdog Millionaire.
We wonder if anybody knows about Peter Jackson’s
presence at the festival, long before he became one
of the biggest directors of our time ?
We’ve followed him from the beginning, since
Bad Taste in 1987 !
Even David Cronenberg visited us, long before
he became the monument that he is today.
We don’t think that the media were there when he
presented Videodrome at the BIFFF.
So many of them have visited the Festival before they
became famous : Luc Besson, Asia Argento,
Gaspar Noe, Benoît Poelvoorde, Alexandre Aja,
Kim Ki-duk, Alex Proyas, Jaume Balaguero,
Shinya Tsukamoto, …
Discoveries of the Festival that ( almost ) went
unnoticed...
You’ll understand why we feel a bit nostalgic, but
we’re also very pleased.
We’ve been true pioneers of cinema and that’s really
the most important role of a film festival.

stimulation of Belgian fantastic film production. That’s
the reason behind the creation of the first Workshop in
1996. Collaborations with professional partners from the
audiovisual field are intended to generate real production
conditions within which film students can realize short
films. The ambition of this initiative has remained
unchanged throughout the years: to offer the students
of our film schools the opportunity to gain experience
by making a fantastic film under the supervision of an
experienced foreign film director. Previous workshops
have been supervised by, among others, Freddie Francis,
Lewis Gilbert, Jack Cardiff, Stuart Gordon, Nick Willing,
Anders Ronnow-Klarlund and Bernard Rose. This year,
the Spanish / British director Alberto Sciamma revealed
some of the secrets of his craft to a new generation of film
professionals. Sciamma, born in Barcelona, but residing
in London, started his career making music videos for
Mute Records. So far he has realised three long features :
The Killer Tongue ( presented at BIFFF in 1997 ), Anazapta
and Jericho Mansions ( presented at BIFFF in 2004 ). The
comedy I Love My Mum with Jennifer Coolidge, the heist
movie Five Idiots and the thriller Fry are Sciamma’s next
targets as a writer/director.
For this 14th edition, BIFFF has collaborated with Rits and
INSAS ( Institut National Supérieur des Arts du Spectacle
et des techniques de diffusion ). During a 8 day shooting
& post prod period, the students had to make 2 fantastic
shorts at the Maritime station of Tour & Taxis, a location
that not only has to represent Brussels, but also had to be
an inspiration for the films. The results will be screened on
Friday 17 April during the Belgian Fantastic Film Day of the
27th BIFFF ( Tour & Taxis ).
The workshop Fantastic Brussels is made possible
thanks to the financial support of the Flemish Community
Commission and the logistic support of Eye-Lite,
Maquillages S.A., Video Facilities and TV Connections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

give the most complete overview of
fantastic film in all its variety and
diversity, closely following every
evolution in the genre. We’ve also
always highlighted its most important
aspects – those of the future, the
present and the past – by focusing
on a certain country, honouring the
pioneers and veterans of the genre,
highlighting the work of certain
production companies or putting the
attention on directors who are not
enough known or recognized by the
cultural “establishment”.
We started this 27th edition with a
special event in collaboration with
the Belgian National Orchestra, Bozar,
Ars Musica and the Cinematek.
On 23 March 2009 at 8pm, the
silent movie “The Fall of the House
of Usher”, was screened in Bozar,
with original music by the Belgian
composer Peter Swinnen. The BNO
was directed by Dirk Brossé. This
project was a world première
The Fall of the House of Usher,
directed in 1928 by Jean Epstein, is
the adaptation of a story by Edgar
Allan Poe. Roderick, last of the
Ushers, asks a friend to join him in
his sinister family mansion. He’s
obsessed with painting the portrait
of his sick wife Madeleine. While
her health keeps deteriorating,
she strangely looks more lively
and vivid on the painting. After her
inexplicable death, she’s buried in the
family crypt. But on a stormy night,
Madeleine returns from her tomb.
The French director and novelist
did not only highlight the fantastic
elements present in Poe’s oeuvre,
his film also showed an experimental
style unseen for the time period. He
was a reputed theorist of cinema,
especially passionate about editing
and camera movement. Epstein,
at first assisted by a certain Luis
Bunuel, made his reputation with this
film, of which the strange images still
fascinate after 80 years.",,,,,,,,,,"Sport Doen,",,,,,,,
