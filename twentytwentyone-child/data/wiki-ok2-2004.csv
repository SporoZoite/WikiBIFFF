In fact, he has been telling tall tales all his life, inflating events in his own life to mythic proportions. Some of the subjects of his stories involve a haggard old witch, a misunderstood giant, a ghost town called Specter, a circus ringmaster who’s a werewolf by night, conjoined Korean lounge singers and a big fish which nobody can catch. When Bloom’s journalist son Will returns to his parent’s house on hearing that his father is dying of cancer, he is determined to separate fact from fiction and get to know the father who was never around when he was growing up. 

Big Fish, the latest film from grandmaster Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow) is not only a heart-touching tale of father-son reconciliation, but also a true feast for the eyes. At the heart of Big Fish is Albert Finney, whose performance as Edward Bloom is as grand and touching as the character itself. Ewan McGregor plays young Edward Bloom, Billy Crudup is Will and there are some sweet cameos from Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Buscemi. The music is, as always, from Danny Elfman (Batman, Mars Attacks, Spiderman)."

Now the Montreal police needs help from an outsider to get inside the head of a serial killer and Illeana is eager to join the case. With meticulous insight, she theorizes that the chameleon-like killer is “life-jacking”; assuming the lives and identities of his victims. As the pressure mounts to catch the elusive murderer, Illeana’s unorthodox methods alienate her from the investigating team. When an unexpected attraction sparks a complicated romantic entanglement, she suddenly finds herself on a twisted and terrifying journey, surrounded by suspects in a case that has become chillingly personal. 

Taking Lives, a psychological thriller in the vein of Se7en and Silence of the Lambs by director D.J. Caruso (The Salton Sea), will keep you on the edge of your seats until the very end. With a top notch cast, including Angelina Jolie (The Bone Collector, Tomb Raider), Ethan Hawke (Gattaca, Training Day), Kiefer Sutherland (Dark City, TV’s 24), Olivier Martinez (Unfaithful, S.W.A.T.) and Gena Rowlands (A Woman Under The Influence, Gloria), and a soundtrack composed by Philip Glass (Koyaanisqatsi, The Hours).

Code 46 is a visionary sci-fi story about two people struggling to survive in the chaos and disorder of the new world. Versatile British filmmaker Michael Winterbottom (Welcome to Sarajevo, The Claim, In This World) uses the deserts of Arabia and the hypermodern skyline of Shanghai as a convincing set for a film that forces us to think about a new and disturbing world that is rapidly taking shape.

Dragon Head is the third manga by Minetaro Mochizuki (Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl) to be adapted for the big screen. George Iida (Ring 2 : Spiral, Another Heaven) filmed the movie on location in Uzbekistan, where the crew was able to construct huge sets and used 80 tons of ash to create an apocalyptic Tokyo.

The same day, a dozen schoolchildren are gunned down by a seemingly stable and responsible cop. As doctor Lacasse and his highly pregnant assistant Jeanne soon discover, the two incidents are linked. It seems that Roy is more than just a writer who dreams up bad stuff for his books. 
Sur le seuil, the debut feature of Canadian director Eric Tessier, is an adaptation of the best selling horror novel by Patrick Senécal, who co-wrote the script. This smart and terrifying modern psycho-killer drama takes us to the edge of terror, exploring the fragile border between madness and sanity. Sur le seuil is a blood-splattered story of murder, demons and bestsellers with a gothic twist."

Harry start studying the black and white surveillance videos from the mall. The killing exists on one of these tapes, but it’s so grainy and diffuse, it’s impossible to make out what’s happening. His pursuit leads him from Wisconsin into Montana and on the trail of a decorated local cop and his wife, who may have crucial information about Harry’s case. But every time Harry thinks he has a handle on things, the solution slithers away from him. He has crossed the line where the quest itself becomes more important than the answer.

Fear X is a supremely elegant, meditative thriller scripted by Hubert Selby Jr. (Requiem for a Dream) and Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn (Bleeder, Pusher) with an intense lead performance by John Turturro (Barton Fink, The Truce) and strong supporting roles by Deborah Unger (The Game, One Point O) and James Remar (What Lies Beneath, 2 Fast 2 Furious). With music by Brian Eno and photography by Larry Smith (Eyes Wide Shot), Fear X is a eerie psycho-drama that plays unnerving mind-games with the audience right down to the end.       "

The Boss orders Minami, a young novice, to kill the troublesome Ozaki, a bitter task, given that Minami views his target as an elder brother. When a car accident does Minami’s dirty work for him, he pulls into a coffee shop in a rundown hamlet to notify the Boss. On returning to the car, he discovers Ozaki’s corpse is gone. His subsequent search for the body is severely complicated by the antics of the lunatics who populate this strange little town. Soon, the unfortunate Minami finds himself sinking away into a surreal quagmire of nightmarish proportions.     

No festival can be complete without at least one film from Japanese shockmeister Takashi Miike (The Audition, the Dead or Alive trilogy, Ichi The Killer). In Gozu, we take a disturbing plunge into the troubled mind of a Yakuza foot soldier. Miike loves to mix genres and here he serves up equal parts ghost story, gangster tale, psychoanalysis and sexual nightmare, climaxing with one of the most shocking finales in movie history.

Somewhere on one of the three levels of New York City, there’s a woman with blue hair crying blue tears. Her name is Jill Bioskop. She doesn’t know it yet, but Horus, the falcon-headed god of ancient Egypt, has cruised half the universe to meet her. Horus has been sentenced to death by his peers. He has just seven days to find Jill in the maze of the city and seduce her. But to do so, he needs to possess a human body, a vehicle of flesh. It will be Alcide Nicopol, a political prisoner who was cryogenised thirty years ago because he knew too much about the New York Apartheid. Meanwhile, the pyramid of the gods flies above Manhattan, aliens make secret plans at the top of skyscrapers and a non-human serial killer walks the streets of Level 1.

After Bunker Palace in 1989 and Tykho Moon in 1996, Immortal is the third film in which acclaimed comic-strip author Enki Bilal brings his world of futuristic urban mutilation and dilapidation to the big screen. Linda Hardy (Recto/Verso) and Thomas Kretschmann (Blade II, The Pianist) take up the leads as Jill Bioskop and Alcide Nicopol. In supporting roles, we’ll also see Charlotte Rampling (Under the Sand, Swimming Pool) and Yann Collette (Tykho Moon, Young Indiana Jones)."

That is, until the day that Dave announces he’s moving out. He’s had enough with the agoraphobic Andrew who never leaves their house. Then Dave gets fired, having to take the fall for his girlfriend who embezzled from Dave’s company. Andrew himself is falsely accused by a mother for sexually touching her Girl Guide daughter. To cap it off, the city condemns their house and plans to demolish it. When the cops surround their ramshackle abode and lob tear gas inside, Dave and Andrew just wish that the world would go away. And that’s exactly what happens. Suddenly, our anti-heroes are transported into a white vacuum where nothing exists apart from their house and themselves. 
Vincenzo Natali, director of 1999’s Silver Raven Cube and last year’s Golden Raven Cypher, triumphantly returns with this surreal and inventive comedy. The art direction and editing are superb, while Natali invests the film with energy throughout. The white space focuses our attention on the two main characters, portrayed by David Hewlett (Cube, Cypher) and Andrew Miller (Cube, Last of the Dogmen) as a sort of Waiting for Godot's Estragon and Vladimir for the Playstation Generation.

After work, she goes looking for booze and men. In a hotel bar, the well-oiled Melanie meets her “perfect stranger”, a charming and attentive sailor. When she falls asleep on his boat, he sails her away to his run-down, candle-lit shack on a remote little island. Melanie is not averse to giving her cultured and caring captor what she assumes he’s after. But the mood between them changes like the weather and soon Melanie not only has to fight for her freedom but also for her common sense. 

Veteran director-writer Gaylene Preston (Mr. Wrong, Bread & Roses) constantly subverts audience expectations as she unwinds her intriguing narrative. Just when we think where she’s going, she changes emotional gear with the invaluable assistance of her two leads. Rachael Blake (Lantana) delivers a bruising, naturalistic performance of considerable nuance and brilliance, paired with a moody, menacing part by Sam Neil (The Piano, Dead Calm, Jurassic Park). Another player to this psychological thriller is the spectacular New Zealand scenery, captured tellingly by cinematographer Alun Bollinger (Heavenly Creatures, The Piano, Lord of the Rings). "

Unless he can meet the prince of Andromeda before a total lunar eclipse, planet Earth will be doomed. In order to get to the prince, he must find an extraterrestrial living on Earth. So Byung-gu kidnaps the most logical suspect, Man-shik Kang, president of the Yoojae Chemical Company. A battle of minds starts between Byung-gu, who’s trying to uncover a secret alien plot to destroy the planet and Man-shik Kang, who thinks his captor is crazy and desperately tries to escape. 

Save the Green Planet, the debut feature of young director Jun-hwan Jang, is a true gem. It contains almost every film genre, from horror to comedy, action and thriller. The daring screenplay, with its surprising plot, shows little regard for Hollywood narrative conventions or for playing it safe commercially. Cinematography and acting are superb, especially Ha-kyun Shin (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) as the anti-hero Byung-gu. In other words, this is a movie to see and a director to watch out for. "

Eun-joo suspects that Su-yeon is behind the strange incidents and locks her in the closet. When Su-mi complains to her father, he just tells her to forget about her sister. The following day, Su-yeon has disappeared. 

A Tale of Two Sisters is based on a classic Korean folk tale and has already been adapted five times for the screen. In this version, director Jee-woon Kim, focuses on the horrors of dysfunctional family life. The maker of The Quiet Family and The Foul King directs with a slow, poetic and dreamy pace. A Tale of Two Sisters is at the same time a terrifying horror movie and a harrowing family drama about jealousy, forgetting and remembrance. "

Meanwhile, Reeve finds out that his vampire-hunting agency has assigned him with a perky young assistant Gypsy, who seems more a hindrance than a help.  

The martial arts action horror comedy Twins Effect is a highly entertaining ride from director Dante Lam (Beast Cops, Tiramisu), containing smart, snappy dialogues, Hollywood style special effects and a bunch of the biggest Hong Kong stars. Helen and Gypsy are played by Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung aka Twins, Asia‘s hottest pop act.

Led by Rene, a beauty queen fallen from grace, a group of desperate survivors finds shelter in an old farmhouse owned by Marion. He was cast out of the town for telling weird tales of alien abduction. With an army of rotten corpses surrounding their sanctuary, the survivors count their ammo. 

Undead is a real treat for zombie fans. The inventive cinematography, tons of gore, acrobatic action, insane weaponry, crazy bursts of sci-fi and dozens of creative ways to tear a body to pieces will delight the aficionados of the undead. The two directors and brothers, Michael and Peter Spierig bow their heads in respect to not only Zombie King George Romero, but also to Sam Raimi, Peter Jackson and even John Woo. Undead is a rollicking horror ride loaded with laughs and shivers that threatens to gush out of the screen.  "

After his arrest, Aro Tolbukhin also confesses to having murdered many more women over a period of fifteen years. After studying the files of earlier unresolved crimes in the judicial enquiry that follows, many major inconsistencies emerge that cast doubt upon the truth about Tolbukhin’s responsibility in the crimes he insists on having committed. He is sentenced to death. Just before his execution, he is interviewed by two French documentary makers. Using this material as a starting point, the film attempts to delve into the psyche of Tolbukhin and explore the reasons for his behaviour.

Aro Tolbukhin In the Mind of a Killer is a joint creation of three directors, Lydia Zimmerman, Isaac P. Racine and the uncompromising iconoclast Agusti Villaronga (The Glass Cage, Moon Child, 99.9). Whether it’s all true or not, is something the makers will not reveal. But the truth has no effect on the captivating power of the end result. The movie magnificently brings together various styles of photography and narration as well as different layers of time and perspective. It can be seen simultaneously as a horror film, a psychological drama, or a pseudo-documentary. Above all, it’s a fascinating cinematic experiment that operates in the borderlands between reality and fantasy.  "

Riding high for the first time in his life, Svend is determined to keep things going, despite Bjarne’s resistance. Soon, people start disappearing. 

Danish director Anders Thomas Jensen is best known as a scriptwriter of the Dogma films Mifune’s Last Song and Open Hearts and for his debut long feature Flickering Lights. His second film, The Green Butchers, is a grisly exploration into the loathsome world of two memorable losers, brilliantly portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen (I Am Dina, Wilbur Wants To Kill Himself) as Svend and Nikolaj Lie Kaas (Possessed, Old Men in New Cars) as Bjarne. Underneath the ink black humor, the merciless social satire and the unrepentant political correctness, lies the need to be accepted and what we’ll do to get it. "

But when his suspects start dying, Simon’s paranoia only accelerates.

OnePo1nt0 is a sci-fi film noir in the spirit of Barton Fink, Delicatessen and Fight Club. The scary, topical debut of directors Jeff Renfroe and Marteinn Thorsson exposes the very real and rapidly evolving science of nanotechnology and explores the impact that the insidious nature of advertising and consumerism may have in a society that can literary put an advertisement in your brain. The compelling subject matter, the expressionist production design, the haunting soundtrack and the terrific performances of Jeremy Sisto (Suicide Kings, Wrong Turn), Deborah Unger (The Game, Fear X), Udo Kier (Blade, Shadow of the Vampire) and Lance Henriksen (Aliens, Dead Man) make OnePo1nt0 a viewing experience to remember.

After learning the ropes by directing the television series Caro Domani, Mariantonia Avati follows in the footsteps of her father, acclaimed Italian director Pupi Avati. Even though the budget of her debut feature didn’t allow grand visual follies (the film was shot in black and white), Avati has written a solid script for her frightening gothic tale, which can count on the acting talents of Patrizio La Bella (Le Sciamane) as Carlo Baldi and Lorenzo Balducci (El Alamein, Il Cuore Altrove, Knight’s Quest) as Luca Anselmi.

Dead Bodies is a clever and entertaining debut feature from Irish director Robert Quinn. The film is stylishly shot and well acted, with strong performances from its young cast.

The detectives try in vain to stop the slaughter, but they are not even sure whether Hyun is behind it or it is the work of a mad copycat.

The urban horror thriller H is definitely not for the squeamish. The debut feature of director Jong-hyuk Lee has the necessary ingredients for a memorable viewing experience : violent murders, a tension-filled investigation and a surprise ending.

His employers not only decide not to pay him, they also beat him into a bloody pulp and leave him for dead in the desert. But Sean is a tough one.

King of the Ants is a powerful, nihilistic and extremely realistic crime story from Festival favorite Stuart Gordon (Re-Animator, Space Truckers, Dagon). It took him almost a decade to find financing for this shocking and disturbing depiction of what humans are capable of inflicting upon one another. The actors are all perfect in their parts. Chris McKenna is outstanding as Sean Crawley. William Baldwin (John Carpenter’s Vampires), Kari Wuhrer (TV’s Sliders, Eight Legged Freaks) and George Wendt (TV’s Cheers, Space Truckers) are all entertaining as hell in their sleazy parts.

Mindhunters by action-maestro Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, The Long Kiss Goodnight) is a fast paced suspense thriller that hits all the right paranoia buttons. Besides the gruesome killings, the characters are constantly at each other's throats, attempting to profile one another at the wrong ends of gun barrels and really nervous trigger fingers.

The atmospheric French Quarter of New Orleans serves as the background for this terrific legal thriller by director Gary Fleder (Kiss the Girls, Impostor). Besides being the battle of the lawyers, Runaway Jury is also the battle of the actors. Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie, Rain Man) and Gene Hackman (The French Connection, Unforgiven) are poised against each other as Wendall Rohr and Rankin Fitch. The clash of these thespian titans is spiced up with the performances of John Cusack (High Fidelity) as Nick Easter and Rachel Weisz (The Mummy) as Marlee.  "

In the tradition of his legendary The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Tobe Hooper (Poltergeist, The Mangler) has created a terrifying vision of a young woman trapped in a battle with supernatural evil. Similar in tone to both classic Italian horror films and landmark 1970s American movies, The Toolbox Murders takes you on a ride that will fuel your nightmares for years to come.

In the middle of nowhere, a huge black monster truck rides up the ass of Adam’s car and nearly forces them off the road. Coincidence or bad luck ? Who knows, but it’s scary and weird. Trouble escalates from there. Finding road kill in their motel beds is half as bad as witnessing a murder executed by the scar-faced occupant of the monster truck. To complicate matters, there is the sexy but mysterious hitchhiker Sarah, who was discovered sleeping in the backseat of their car.

Monster Man is an outrageous teen horror comedy from director Michael Davis (Girl Fever, 100 Girls). Low on budget, but packed with ingenuity, gore and humour, this movie is a riveting cross between Duel and Jeepers Creepers. The cast are all veterans of the genre. Eric Jungman and Justin Urich, the two college palls appeared in Not Another Teen Movie and Carrie 2. Aimee Brooks, who plays sexy Sarah, starred in Hillside Strangler and the monster man himself, Michael Bailey Smith, is a seasoned latex-wearer for films such as Men in Black II and Black Mask 2.

But these new friends have a dark sinister side, and when Willard uses them as instruments of vengeance, he soon finds out they have an evil plan of their own. 

Willard, written by James Wong and directed by Glen Morgan, the creators of Final Destination, is a horror movie with genuine style, a witty screenplay and top-notch performances that walk the fine line between high camp and high drama. Crispin Glover (Wild at Heart, Nurse Betty) inhabits Willard’s skin as if it were his own. Jackie Burroughs (The Dead Zone, Careful) plays a wonderfully grotesque mother. R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) is fittingly evil and mean as the boss and Laura Harring (Mulholland Drive) spices things up as Willard's sexy co-worker. "

The Ying-Yang Master II takes us back to an era when people and demons lived in the same world. Director Yojiro Takita has created an authentic world, with stunning costumes and setting. At the core of the movie is the relation between the carefree and enigmatic Seimei, played by Mansai Nomura (Ran, Ying-Yang Master I) and the brave but naïve Hiromasa.

The rules are so contradictory and so senseless that he is forced to sacrifice everything he once held dear. Kafka meets The Twilight Zone in this surreal medium length Australian thriller by debut director Shane McNeil and first time scriptwriters Shaun Duncan and Scott Richards, starring Damon Gameau (The Tracker) as Mark Waterman.

From that moment, the acacia tree becomes the focus of paranormal occurrences and inexplicable deaths.

Ki-hyung Park, director of horror hit Whispering Corridors and the unsettling Secret Tears, presents us with a turbulent tale of the dark side of childhood and family. The film focuses on the hatred of children who are abandoned by a selfish society. When these children start to curse the world, the result is an unimaginable tragedy. Acacia is not just a horror film that slowly takes you by the throat, it also tackles the problem of social alienation. "

After Love Will Tear Us Apart, presented in official selection at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, All Tomorrow’s Parties is the second film of promising young Chinese director Yu Lik Wai.

After strong-arming the astronaut into joining him in a dance contest, the Pirate presents him with a plan for a multi-planet package swap that will earn them both a lot of money. It involves a cloning device for creating the rarest creature in this space quadrant : a real live girl, the Boy Who Actually Saw A Woman's Breast and Body Suit, the offspring of two lonely space miners. But the real danger lies in Curtis’ old nemesis Professor Hess, a mad scientist hell-bent on killing everyone the astronaut comes in contact with. 

To describe The American Astronaut as an expressionist low budget black and white sci-fi musical that draws its inspiration from Ed Wood, Flash Gordon and Samuel Beckett… would be a good start. Eccentric, perverse and hilarious, this instant cult movie is the brainchild of writer-director-lead actor Cory McAbee and the other members of The Billy Nayer Show, a band that combines rock music with absurd lyrics and theatrical flair. The American Astronaut definitely belongs to that rare category of films that cannot be described but have to be seen.  "

Once again, Japan’s action maestro, Ryuhei Kitamura (Versus, Aragami, Alive) will delight us with exquisitely choreographed fight scenes and savagely bloody imagery. Azumi is an adaptation of the very popular and shocking manga by Yu Koyama. Kitamaru’s intention was to make a modern Akira Kurosawa film that would dazzle the world with the unique style and flair of the Japanese swordfight. The final battle scene alone, in which Azumi has to fight 200 samurai to the death, took two months to film. "

Its first victims are a group of juvenile delinquents from Shikanotoride High School. Abducted by the army, they are forced to wear military uniforms and lethal electronic necklaces. In three days they must flush out and kill the terrorist Nanahara. If they fail, they will all die.

Three years ago, in the shock hit Battle Royale, legendary yakuza film director Kinji Fukasaku (Battles Without Honor And Humanity) presented a creative solution to the problem of troubled teenagers : ship them all to an island and let them kill each other. In this controversial, bigger, bolder and bloodier sequel, he goes head to head with the “war on terrorism”, asking important questions and giving disturbing answers. He died before being able to finish the project, but his son Kenta, who also scripted the two films, was able to complete his father’s vision. "

Everything seems to be under control, until Hiroe sees her own face plastered everywhere on prostitution adds. Then the phone rings. She picks it up and the nightmare begins; an endless hallucinatory ordeal haunted by her dead client. With her girlfriends at her side and any object that can hack, slice or amputate in her grasp, she prepares to face off against the pervert from beyond the grave.

The Big Slaughter Club is as well a horrific parody of the omnipresent Asian ghost movie as a pure cold-sweat chiller. That it might make you think of Takashi Miike’s Visitor Q is no coincidence. The film is directed by Hitoshi Ishikawa, screenwriter of Miike’s Dead or Alive : Final and its star, Kenichi Endo, was not only the father in Visitor Q but also appeared in Dead or Alive and Deadly Outlaw Rekka. The Big Slaughter Club is a very enjoyable demented spectacle with a monster that’s more disturbing than The Ring’s Sadako, more malevolent than The Grudge’s Toshio and busier than Freddy or Jason !

With The Blessing Bell, Sabu (Monday, Unlucky Monkey, Drive) continues his exploration of contemporary Japan with his trademark deadpan sense of humour and his distinctly bizarre fondness for coincidence. His precise direction maintains our suspension of disbelief, despite the outlandish nature of some of the situations.

First-time director Bo Welch, the talented production designer for Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands and Batman Returns, has created a true feast for the eyes.

Dead End Run is the first film of Sogo Ishii (Labyrinth of Dreams, Gojoe) since the spectacular Electric Dragon 80,000 V. And to our great joy, he continues on the road taken. Ishii's films blend the breathless nature of commercials and action films with the uncompromising sensibility of the experimental film.

No festival seems to be complete without a movie that mercilessly targets reality TV shows. After The Contenders in 2002 and My Little Eye in 2003, El Nominado is next to presents us with an ironic view on the demented descendants of Big Brother. The two young directors, Nacho Argiro and Gabriel Lopez maintain a fine balance between satire and tension and obviously had a lot of fun putting the lead motive of their film, “kill for ratings”, into practice."

Shot over five years with virtually no budget, “borrowed” equipment and with cast and crew working for free, Fatigue is a triumph of perspiration and endurance for its three makers, director Michael Barnes and producers Mark Faiers and Chris Dawson. Inspired by other no-budget success stories as Bad Taste, Evil Dead and El Mariachi, Fatigue is a fast paced, visually inventive surreal action thriller. Despite its limited means, it manages to shock, disturb and entertain the audience, qualities that are often absent in today’s big budget extravaganzas.  "

After his debut, the drama The Disappeared, starring Anouk Grinberg and Grégoire Colin, French director Gilles Bourdos has adapted the Ruth Rendel novel, A Sight for Sore Eyes, to the big screen. By opting not to view things through the eyes of the victim, Bourdos presents us with a coherent and chilling portrait of obsession and monomania.

LD 50 is an imaginative British low budget horror thriller by debut director Simon de Selva and writer Matthew McGuchan.

Set in the dead of night in the scariest part of New Zealand, these likeable, innocent young guys and galls are pitted against the things humans fear the most: being lost, being in the dark and being chased by an unknown, menacing foe. It's the dead versus the living, played out against an inescapable curse with escalating levels of fear. 

The Locals is a marvellously entertaining horror film from debut director Greg Page. It’s another addition to a internationally successful string of New Zealand horror flicks. But instead of opting for conventional or splatter comedy horror, Page makes this a deeply chilling ghost story. The Locals stars John Barker (Mercy Peak), Dwayne Cameron (The Tribe, Street Legal), Kate Elliott (Toy Love, Street Legal) and newcomer Aidee Walker. "

The question is : will they save the world or are we all in deep shit ?

Mortadela & Filemon : The Big Adventure, based on the immensely popular comic strip of Francisco Ibanez, broke all box office records when it was released in Spain. The special effects and complicated production design are seamless and the actors, among which Dominique Pinon (Delicatessen, Alien Resurrection) embody their buffoonish caricatures to perfection. The constant onslaught of cartoonish Tom & Jerry like violence and the clever use of music and editing makes Mortadel & Filemon fun to watch for young and old. "

Croy suggests to implant Ria’s memory chip into a human body. 

Natural City is a Korean sci-fi action extravaganza in the tradition of Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell by director Byung-cheon Min (Phantom, the Submarine). Based on hard science speculation about how the future might look, Min has built an enormous set envisioning a city in the year 2080. Add to this the eye-catching visual work, the dreamy musical score and the performance of lead actor Ji-tae Yoo (Into the Mirror, Old Boy), and you’ll be swept away by this spectacular and melodramatic love story."

But it’s becoming clear that nefarious human puppet masters are really pulling the strings. When The Branch comes close to sniffing out clues, the body count escalates and no one, cop, citizen or robot, is safe.

Parasite Dolls, a anime version of Strange Days meets Blade Runner, is a compelling trilogy in which we see a world where humanity is as much a thing of machines, as of ""biological"" units. The strong storylines, the well developed characters and a great soundtrack give the film a real emotional feel. Parasite Dolls is the first full feature animation of directors Naoyuki Yoshinaga, who gained experience working for the Patlabor Tv series, and Kazuto Nakazawa, most noted for directing the anime in Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill.

The Feast of the Praying Mantis is the first long feature of acclaimed Belgian short film maker Marc Levie. It‘s the realization of an old dream, which he‘s had for fifteen years. With this fantasy thriller, he inscribes himself in a tradition that goes back to Breughel, Jean Ray and Harry Kummel.

Ju has hardly entered play when he’s stripped of his identity and powers. Meanwhile the Match Girl herself goes renegade and start taking her defense into her own hands.

Not only the most expensive movie ever made, Resurrection of the Little Match Girl is also the first film to see the supposed seductions of alternative realities in Taoist terms. Director Sun-woo Jang, maker of Lies and Timeless, Bottemless Bad Movie has given his movie a grungy look, stuffing it with spectacular action scenes, choreographed by Hong Kong specialists Daniel Yu and Raymond Fung.

For the part of the legendary sorcerer, the brothers and the film’s director, maestro Pino Grisanti, decide to hire the faded old Hollywood glory, the great Erroll Douglas.  

Daniele Cipri and Franco Maresco, the mavericks of Sicilian cinema (Toto Who Lived Twice, Cinico TV) are back with their first colour feature, featuring professional actors and even female characters. As usual, they lack any sense of restraint and lyrically portray numerous scabrous and scatological subject matters in this hilarious film about human stupidity.

Savage Island, the debut feature film of Jeffery Scott Lando, is a dark and twisted story of human savagery with an extremely unexpected ending. Reminiscent of Wes Craven’s The Hills Have Eyes and Walter Hill’s Southern Comfort, Savage Island will keep your attention with its surprisingly cruel turn of events.

Roam the festivals and markets, gather some four to five hundred tasty looking morsels of film. Leave to soak for a few months, chop to pieces, bring to the boil, let it simmer and then cream off. 

What remains are some seventy little jewels with a crunchy European crust (40 % of which one Belgian movie!) and a spicy Asian filling (30%). Add to this an American sauce (20%) and season with rarities from Australia, Mexico, Chile, Canada and New Zealand. 

At the first bite, a strong flavour of science-fiction pervades, mixed with a combination of horror, humour and satire. The aftertaste is composed of a whiff of Sword & Sorcery, a dash of Kung-fu and a pinch of fairytales. It's the ultimate movie buff's treat!

2004,event,Workshop,,"9th Workshop ""Brussels Fantastic""",,,,,"The 9th workshop ""Fantastic Brussels"" 
 
The ninth workshop ""Fantastic Brussels"" has been transformed. Not only the change of name (to stress the importance of the role of the capital), but also a change in schedule. The starting date has been moved up with one week in order to let their results coincide with the International Short Film competition. 

The main goal of the most important educational part of the festival remains the same: giving the students of the film schools (Rits and Narafi) the opportunity to direct three films in a factual situation and familiarize them with special effects and techniques. Therefore the students are assisted by B&L, Jean-Pierre Finotto's make-up school, Apple, Double Precision and postproduction studio Ciné & Fx. 

As every year, the students can count on the advice and support of a famous guest director. This year, genre specialist George A. Romero, famous for the 'Living Dead Trilogy', Creepshow and The Dark Half, would have done us the honour of being workshop counsellor for twelve days. Because of an unexpected breakthrough in the financing for his latest project, he had to limit himself to the development of the scripts and will only be able to attend the screening of the end results. Luckily, Julien Vrebos, the flamboyant Belgian director of Le Bal Masqué and The Emperor's Wife, graciously agreed to assist the students during the shooting and editing. 

A new feature is that the location is only one specific place in Brussels. It ought to be big enough to shoot in- and outdoors. The students have to adapt their screenplay to this location, the national administrative centre, which is a pearl among modernistic architecture close to the Passage 44. 

The results will be shown to the festival audience on Sunday, 21st of March at 4pm, between the screening of the International short films and the prize ceremony. The most praiseworthy students will be awarded with a diploma and a prize (for photography, scenario, exposure,…). The first prize is a gift voucher of 2500 euros, offered by B&L, to support the winners' next project. And the SACD has offered a prize for a value of 1500 euros. The ceremony ends with an encounter of professionals, press, sponsors, public governments and students. 

This 9th workshop is established with the assistance of the Flemish Community Commission (Department of Education and Department of Culture) and with the collaboration of the film schools Narafi and Rits, Jean Pierre Finotto's make-up school, Bulterys & Locaflash, TV-Brussels, SACD,  Apple Belgium – Luxemburg, Double Precision and Ciné & Fx.

While commentators agreed that time had come for the rise of authors who were likely to act as guru in their own field, reality looks quite the opposite. After a troubled period of acquisitions of small structures and bankruptcies: the videogame scene is now ripe for a period dominated by big studios, each of them putting forward their own ""touch"" on products. In addition to Nintendo and Ubi Soft, obviously the most present actors on the market this year, others, such as Atari, Microsoft, Sega, Konami, Capcom or Electronic Arts have become the big moguls of the industry, providing the consumers with mainstream blockbusters and smaller, more daring, B-series games.
Fans of the first generation may find it most regrettable that small-scale amateurship has disappeared. They have to content themselves with the existing market of mass production.
Videogames have conquered their spot in the entertainment business at the expense of the amateurish charm.

Frederic March won an oscar in 1931 for his performance of the sexual frustrated Victorian scientist, directed in an expressionist version by Rouben Mamoulian. The MGM remake of 1941 by Victor Fleming attracted attention by its outstanding cast (Spencer Tracy, Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner) and the luxuriant mise-en-scène, including a Freudian dream sequence. Last but not least there is the silent way of John S. Robertson (1920) which will be adorned by a Live Soundtrack of Geert Waegeman. 

This last screening is more than a live concert: Geert Waegeman created a contemporary and hazardous composition. It turns this project into unique, dramatic confrontation between silent film and video with acoustic and electronic music. It is not surprising that Waegeman uses a schizophrenic phonetic method: there is room for the piano, electronic mandolin, viola and a big amount of electronics and samples. Melancholic techno, futuristic baroque, sexy rhythms, Morricone whistles, Kraftwerk vs. Piazolla… The old art of piano music accompaniment is here combined with a contemporary approach.

Since 28 Days Later, the dead seem to be more alive then ever! Time, we thought,  to take the undead as our main theme in this year's retrospective at Cinema Nova.  Generally called zombie, this fringe figure within the horror genre became a world wide plague as the result of the success of George A. Romero's Living Dead trilogy.

Zombies used to be associated with exotic voodoo practices and Haitian sorcery (White Zombie with Bela Lugosi from 1932 and I Walked With a Zombie by Jacques Tourneur from 1941, for example). But since Romero made his low budget film Night of the Living Dead (1968), the modern flesh-eating zombie came to be. While adding a good dose of social satire and culture criticism,  he took horror out of the gothic and mythological strongholds and put it at the doorstep of small town America. The Crazies (1973), Dawn of the Dead (1979) and Day of the Dead (1985) flirt with such contemporary issues as race, role patterns, consumerism, commodity fetishism and militarism (Vietnam).

The box-office success of Night and Dawn of the Dead didn't went unnoticed. In their slipstream, a succession of imitations en deviations followed first in the U.S. and later also in Europe. In Spain, Jorge Grau (The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue, 1974) and Amando De Ossorio (tetra-logy of the dead templars) are the most important representatives, while Italian directors such as Andrea Bianchi, Bruno Matei and Joe d’Amato exhausted the formula in such a way that in a very short time (1979-1981) the craze dies a sudden death.

One director, Lucio Fulci, however, towers above the others with his more metaphysical and cerebral films like Zombie2 (1979), City of the Living Dead (1980) and The Beyond (1981). He totally disconnects the zombie from a social context and portraits them as impersonal and inhuman messengers of doom, representing death and (catholic) hell. Which differentiates the Italian zombie film from its American counterpart, is that it is less character-based, plot-driven and attentive to verisimilitude. As a result of this weakened attention for coherence and probability and (often deliberate) spaciotemporal disorientation, the narration gives way to the spectacle. A structural element, of which Fulci was an accomplished proprietor, that illustrates most effectively this inclination for pure spectacle is the mechanism of the so-called “set piece”: zombie(s) chase a random victim, often a minor character, and kill it in some elaborate and extremely cruel way. This long sequence has often nothing but one long scream as dialogue! A lot of violence on particularly sensitive body parts is inflicted and some of them (like poking an eye out) keep on returning as a thematic element.

The success of the living dead film coincides with social and technical breakthroughs: the liberalization of the censorship and the enormous progression on the field of special make-up effects turned the seventies into an era full of pined away, bursting and torn apart corpses.  Make-up artists like Tom Savini and Gianetto De Rossi started their career in this field. But in order to surpass the former films, directors searched for even more extraordinary effects, which turned the genre into a funny but one-dimensional and often less scary grand guignol extravaganza. In the eighties the living dead films were positively taken less serious then before. 
While films like Return of the Living Dead (Dan O’Bannon), Evil Dead (Sam Raimi) and the slightly over-the-top productions from Stuart Gordon (Re-animator) and Peter Jackson (Braindead) left little to the imagination, such brainless Z-films like Redneck Zombies, I Was a Zombie for the FBI, Zombie Campus and Kung Fu Zombie send the genre straight into oblivion. This is, until in recent years a revival occurred with imaginative and original living dead entries like Versus (Rhuyei Kitamura, 2001), Dead Creatures (Andrew Parkinson, 2001) and 28 Days Later (Dany Boyle, 2002).

In Cinema Nova we always try to keep a broad perspective on our theme. We could have limited our selection to representations of the living dead as bloody flesh-eating machines that pump our adrenaline to unknown levels, but our choice is more tempting for the audience. Carnival of Souls (Herk Harvey 1962) a film that inspired Romero’s Night, functions as a template for a more existential, spiritualized and disturbing take on the undead. In such weird and unsettling films like Zeder, Dead of Night, Messiah of Evil and, yes,  Jacob’s Ladder we are confronted with the thin line between the real, the inexplicable and the imagination. These films often work on a subconscious level in that they try to arouse our primal death fear by using alienating, cinematographic techniques. Uncanny seems to be the most appropriate term. Something is uncanny, as Freud stated, if the border between fantasy and reality becomes blurred and when something described as fantastic, turns out to be real.

So, the fantastic film will shows us its most surprising side at Cinema Nova. Sixteen films, some of them scarcely screened, some unique prints specially imported from the U.S,  are waiting to be (re)discovered on the big screen.

These clothes, in a presentation by Billie Mertens, were designed for dance, theatre and, of course, cinema and bear the signature of some big names in Belgian fashion, such as (t.b.c.) : Kaat Tilley, Sofie D’Hoore, Azniv Afsar, Bea Pendesini, Marie Cabanac, …",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2004,event,Art Exhibition,,1st Brux-Hell Exhibition,,,,,"Once upon a time, there was “Bruss-Hell”. With this magical phrase, which opens the doors of fantasy and imagination, our story begins.  

Ever since Salvius Brabo threw the hand of the giant Antigoon in the river Scheld, Belgium became a country drenched with fantasy. Our painters have assimilated this for a long time, from Bosch to Rops by passing through the inevitable Magritte. The list is too long to name them all. 

It’s in the spirit of extending this tradition that three Big, Beautiful, Admired, Brilliant and Elevated Brussels Fantasy Galleries (or the B.B.A.B.E.B.F.G), being the Museum of Fantasy Art, the Arkel Body Art Gallery and the Galerie d’Enfer, under the protective wings of their foster mother, the Brussels International Festival of Fantastic Film (the BIFFF), united to form the horrible and monstrous collective “Bruss-Hell”.

This exhibition will delight our thirsty and alcoholic admirers (we won’t mention any names, even under torture), because during the Festival, it will take place at the bar of the Passage 44. The walls of the B.B.A.B.E.B.F.G. will of course also be plastered with fantasy art.  

This year, the artists-initiators will launch an invitation to everybody who would like to participate to this joint exhibition in 2005. By means of a contest, we’ll select the best of you and the exhibited works will be immortalised in a catalogue. Even more, a website, where the artists will be able to virtually exhibit their works, will be accessible during the entire year.
