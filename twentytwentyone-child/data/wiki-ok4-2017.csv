learning. Every morning she counts the seconds before the beginning
of classes and prepares well in advance in her padded cell. Every time,
the ritual is the same. She takes place in a wheelchair where her arms,
legs and head are immobilized. Then two heavily armed soldiers take
her out of her cell to the classroom. There she joins the other pupils,
who also look like little Hannibal Lecters. You might think that this
is Donald Trump’s wet dream of a boot camp for illegals, but the
situation is even more serious. A virus has reduced the majority of
the world’s population into a bunch of ravenous cannibals that are
as hungry as they are violent. Melanie and the other children are a
hybrid species. They’re cannibals on a diet as long as the survivors
apply a special gel to their skin. But these kids might hold the key to
stop this global carnage, provided that everyone keeps their little tube
of ointment at hand. Otherwise they’ll turn into a free for all buffet.
It’s not that often that the English make a post-apocalyptic zombie
film. After all, it’s hard to surpass 28 Days Later. But with Colm
McCarthy’s adaptation of Mike Carey’s bestseller, we finally have a
worthy successor. The director of Outcast, Peaky Blinders and Doctor
Who has gathered a top-notch cast, including Glenn Close, Gemma
Arterton and Paddy Considine, for a survival epic that brilliantly reinvents
the cat and mouse game with fierce flesh eaters.
No wonder we’re kicking off the BIFFF with The Girl
With All The Gifts."

and Gordon, two brothers as tight as Hillary and Donald, decide to
liquidate the video club of their dad and get as much money out of it
as they can. There’s not a lot of respect for this shrine to 80ties movie
culture, where tapes of Delta Force 8 and American Ninja 12 jointly
gather dust on the shelves. While they’re clearing out the back room,
the brothers come across an interactive game that’s called Beyond the
Gates. Unable to resist the temptation and especially incredibly lucky
to still have a functioning vhs player at hand, John, Gordon and his
girlfriend Margot decide to play the game. A woman named Evelyn
appears on the screen to explain the game and sends shivers down
their spines when she says that, if they do well, they might get some
answers to their father’s disappearance...
Jackson Stewart’s feature debut has a delightfully retro atmosphere,
surfing on the nostalgia wave for all Stranger Things. With a solid
script by Stephen Scarlata (Final Girl) and supported by the legendary
Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator), Stewart offers us a clever mix of
Jumanji and Hellraiser that will delight fans of Lucio Fulci and Don
Coscarelli!"

is walking through the city streets while she’s chatting on her mobile
about her love live. She decides to have a coffee in a nearby bar,
where the patrons are already gobbling up their breakfast. Suddenly
a loud bang sounds in the streets. In front of the bar lies the body of
a man with a gunshot wound to his head. One of the clients dares to
venture outside… and undergoes the same fate. The others panic
and desperately search for cover. What the hell is going on? Why are
the streets deserted? Is there a sniper on the roofs? Does anybody in
the bar have something to do with this? If they’re going to survive
this, they’ll have to work together. But that’s easier said than done!
BIFFF regular Alex De La Iglesia has another delight in store for us.
His latest film entirely takes place in a bar, where a colorful bunch of
characters will collide with each other. From one moment to the next,
they can switch from solidarity to selfishness, from helplessness to
pity and from compassion to hate. The Bar is a very feisty thriller and
a delicious dark comedy as only De La Iglesia is capable of delivering.
The cast is led by Blanca Suarez (Neon Flesh, My Big Night) as Elena,
with solid support by Mario Casas (The Invisible Guest, Witching and
Bitching), Terele Pavez (The Last Circus) and Jaime Ordonez (Torrente)."

a large manor lost in the Irish forests and calls on Joseph Solomon, an
occultist specializing in black magic. He subjects her to a strict diet:
no sex or alcohol (at least for her) during the session. It’s not because
he considers her an alcoholic nymphomaniac, but it’s because this
famous session will last for six months. It’s an emotional and physical
investment that will push both of them to the edge and beyond, with
doubt and paranoia constantly switching places. Will the effort pay
off? Sophia did not tell Joseph her true motivations to undergo this
ordeal. And nuance is important to occultists. Good intentions bring
good spirits. Bad intentions on the other hand...
The feature debut by Liam Gavin, a former story-boarder for Simon
Hunter (Lighthouse, Mutant Chronicles) and Jake West (Evil Aliens), is
a disconcerting piece of work that has been described by many as a real

rituals that will break your body and mind. No one will get out of this
unharmed. With terrific performances by Steve Oram (The World’s End,

Dead Man Tells His Own Tale is a hilarious fable about the battle of the

avoiding panties like the plague to be worthy of Aiko. And then a

her husband, a failed writer. Inspector Kildare of Scotland Yard gets both
cases on his plate. And this is not because his intellect rivals that of Sherlock

even thinks that she can lead him to the golem. But the clock is ticking.
The people, the press and his superiors want to see blood. Someone will

The Limehouse Golem is anything but a respectful BBC drama. Director Juan

Even Charles Dickens would have paled when confronted with the stench,

unforgiving world. The theater here functions as a refuge for everybody
who feels out of place in this rigid society. The Limehouse Golem is a terrific
Giallo-like murder mystery with a great script by Jane Goldman (Kick

excellent as inspector Kildare, but it’s Olivia Cooke (The Signal, Ouija) who

this common mistake and has turned it into a nail-biting thriller that
explores our relationship to the hyper-protective tech environment in
which we live and that increasingly overrules our own choices. Right
in the middle of the ultimate parental nightmare, we find the phenomenal
Katrina Bowden (Tucker and Dale VS Evil), ready to tear out
the battery of Lilith, voice of the Monolith, interpreted by Katherine
Kelly Logan, husband collector in The Bold and the Beautiful."

Until one morning she discovers a spot of dried-up skin on her hand. Terrified
by the decay of her body, Kira is desperately searching for a cure. But
the disease keeps spreading, and nobody seems to be able to help. Devastated,
Kira finds some comfort in her neighbor, the very sensual Sophia.
Attracted by her bubbly and no-nonsense attitude, she starts falling in love
with Sophia and her perfect, flawless skin. As the disease progresses, Kiras
options run out. But a terrifying discovery changes everything. She is able
to replace her own dried-up skin with healthy skin from somebody else.
Kira seems to have found a way to stay young and beautiful: replacing her

And the danger of being discovered by the police or her newly-found lover
Sophia is getting bigger all the time. Kira has to choose. Continue taking
the skin of other girls, or face the inevitable decay of her body.
German director Norbert Keil, author of the multi-award winning Bathtub

Replace is all about fear, fear of old age, the decay of your body and the
inevitability of death. Our protagonist has to bend the rules and even
break them. How much of her morality is she willing to sacrifice to be
young and beautiful? And is that even necessary for her to be content?

of ourselves onto ourselves or if that image is something that already
exist inside our head? Watch out for the legendary Barbara Crampton

is forced to go to “work” at the military office and never comes back.
After a couple of months that feel like years to him, Djata decides to

Adhering to the strict rules of the boarding school is hard, but Giulio
finds a good friend in Edoardo, who is maybe a little crazy, but who
seems the smartest of all. They find out that security becomes more
relaxed at night and they start running away to a nightclub in the

obliged to work with producers who have as much artistic fiber as
an Ikea carpet. Dewey, for example, is ready to step into the project
if Catherine adds a talking dog. Nathan, another deceitful fundraiser,
demolishes her dream casting and imposes “bankable” faces. Already
stuck with that damn dog she has to fit into the film somehow, Catherine
sees her romantic lead transformed into an obese seal with the
looks of a stuffed carp. But he’ll bring in soooo much money. Besides
the dog now having to become a 3-D mod for the Chinese market,
Catherine’s image also needs to be glamorized. Hence the photoshoot
of her in SM attire with a chainsaw. This Faustian deal is slowly
but inevitably putting her on the brink of a psychotic breakdown.
Kate Shenton is no unknown to genre aficionados. In 2013 she
unleashed On Tender Hooks, a docu fiction about a very obscure

knocking on his door and accepts the young mother’s offer. While
Joaquin is cultivating his misanthropy in his basement, he starts hearing
voices coming from behind the cellar walls. Curious by what he
hears through a cheap stethoscope, he develops a spy system by
placing camera’s in the wall. He discovers that a gang of thieves is
digging a tunnel to rob the bank on the other side of the street and
this tunnel is right beneath his cellar!
Rodrigo Grande’s latest thriller is a bit like the cinematographic equivalent
of a sauna: you’ll sweat bucket-loads of tension, but you’ll come
out revived! This masterpiece brings together the talent of Federico
Luppi (Chronos), Leonardo Sbaraglia (Wild Tales) and Clara Lago (The
End, BIFFF 2013) and is very generous with its references (The Maltese
Falcon, The Great Escape). It certainly didn’t steal its reputation as an
Argentinian box-office hit."

gets through the days searching for anal abnormalities in all kinds of

Seung-hoon is not exactly looking forward to yet another

and Seung-houn knows where he can stick his Hippocratic oath !
Korean director Soo-youn Lee certainly took her time. 13 years after

Ben Parker’s feature debut plays out like a crossing between Das Boot

After the mindfuck that was High-Rise, Ben Weathley completely

Prisons have always been great places for thrillers (Brubaker, Oz, Lock

because his business is demons and his knowledge of these abominations
far exceeds the director’s cut of The Exorcist! Jebediah knows
all the signs of demonic possession and he has a custom tailored
remedy for each case. But what awaits him in Chicory Creek, a small,
once peaceful town in Mississippi, is likely to surpass all his glorious
victories against Beelzebub’s cohorts. Not only is the specimen he’s
about to confront one of a kind (if you kill the possessed, you become
possessed in turn), he also has to deal with a population more faithful
to the 2nd Amendment than to their own family. Jebediah gears up
for a giant fight with the biggest demonic scumbag of all time...
After the big fun of Big Ass Spider! (2013), Mike Mendez (The Convent,
Tales of Halloween) returns with a very inspired mix between Evil Dead
and Fallen, adding an extremely generous spoonful of cartoon-like
gore. Don’t Kill It is deliciously politically incorrect, tackling all the
NRA fanatics who fill up the cemeteries more than refugees from
the Middle East. On the casting side, it’s just as exciting. Alongside
Kristina Klebe (Halloween), there’s the only Swedish mountain in
Hollywood: Dooooooooolph Lundgren!!!"

and Brooklyn, this is the opportunity to hit the road for a crazy holiday.
If the girls are already sipping a Dr Pepper while thinking about
coconut oil on the beach, our three males have definitely decided to
let their hormones rage. That coconut oil will be used for something
else than preventing sunburns... But that’s without counting a first
stop at a shabby motel, where a particularly ferocious STD has recently
transformed into a concierge with nymphomaniac tendencies.
The infection spreads through orifices which decency prevents us
from naming. With young, adolescent flesh being incredibly weak,
our horny youngsters will have to face trouser snakes with teeth.
The night is going to be a real fiesta of body fluids, which will make
a prison shower look like a little harmless massage.
Are you nostalgic for the good old days of John Waters when everything
was allowed and no taboo was safe? Then Jonathan Straiton’s
new film is something for you. Night of Something Strange is one
classy pinata of bad taste spilling politically incorrect candy at every
blow. Gore, sex, silly jokes; this movie has the finesse of a horny
baboon that shows no restraint. The film scandalized quite a few
spectators in the United States who seemed to have forgotten what
a true Midnight Movie is. Well, this dose of midnight madness is

porn channels. Their mission? Above all, not to fall asleep at work.
But when the coffin of a famous clown, who mysteriously kicked
the bucket during a tour in Romania, is mistakenly delivered to their

down. The corpse is not so dead as it looks and awakes with quite
an appetite. And with the editorial staff pulling an all-nighter, there
are plenty of tasty morsels around. It’s up to our watchmen to save
everybody... if they weren’t so busy trying to save themselves.
The Night Watchmen, directed by Mitchell Altieri (The Hamiltons,

dares to set foot in her ancestral home. And she’s really good at this.
With the assistance of her faithful servant Gwilherm, nobody is able
to last more than a few days after discovering chopped-off heads in
the laundry basket, seeing sheets with ball and chain in the corridors
or a nicely timed “booooh!”. But that’s about to change when the Otis

these 21st Century urbanites. Even worse, the children play pranks
on her and the parents just ignore her. Only 15-year old Virginia Otis
cares about the fate of the Canterville ghost and will try to release
her from the curse.

The debut feature of Zack Whedon (brother of Josh) is a welcome

Death Note, The mythical manga of Tsugumi Oba and Takeshi Obata,

two directed by Shusuke Kaneko, presented at the BIFFF, and Hideo
Nakata’s spin-off, L: Change the World. This time, it’s the best of the
best who directs this epic finale: Shinsuke Sato, responsible for The

this, as he prepares the American remake."

access to the set of her newest film, a serial killer crime thriller, by having
purchased a one line role via the film’s crowdfunding website. Herbert
steals wardrobe from the set, all of the film’s footage by hijacking the
password to the production’s download site and eventually stalks and
kidnaps Pyle herself. His psychotic goal is to reshoot the film in his dungeon
studio, recasting himself as the romantic lead. Pyle is literally acting for
her life. The end result is a mad mash-up of scenes from the real movie,
outtakes, clips from other movies and the lo-fi footage delusional psycho
Herbert has created. He’s even recorded a director’s commentary track,
which plays throughout the entire film, acting as an insane narrative device
from a very unreliable narrator.
Director’s Cut, the ultimate “meta movie” is an insane, cinematic
sleight of hand trick that reflects on itself, much like the stage persona
of its co-star and creator, world famous illusionist Penn Jillette. Here,
teamed with director Adam Rifkin, Jillette conjures a mind bending,
genre-defying movie-within-a-movie mash-up that’s part narrative
thriller, part documentary. The madness that unwinds behind the
scenes will leave you reeling. Starring Missi Pyle (Galaxy Quest, Gone
Girl), Harry Hamlin (Clash of the Titans, Mad Men) and genre icon Lyn
Shaye as themselves and, of course, Penn Juliette. Watch out for the

to his usual bullshit; killing as many humans as possible. Let’s just
say that this will serve as extra motivation to get out of the room.
It’s inevitable that the social phenomenon of escape rooms would
start popping up in movies. And director Peter Dukes has delivered

The Icebreaker is Sergey Kozlov’s newest production, after Metro, the

More than ten years after presenting Trouble at the BIFFF, Harry Cleven
is back and stronger than ever. Mon Ange is a beautiful romanticfantasy
fable, produced by Jaco Van Dormael and Olivier Rausin
and a script by Thomas Gunzig. The movie stars Elina Löwensohn
(Schindler’s List, Dark Water) and Fleur Geffrier (Paul Verhoeven’s

the marshes of the bayou, occasionally killing a 12 gauge alligator
to waste time. Ten years now that his elder brother was beaten to
death by their father, just because he had the bad idea to soak his
noodle in the same place as his unfaithful procreator. Ten fucking
long years since Asher became deaf and dumb after getting a beating
from dad. Since then, the latter languishes in prison. But when Asher
learns that he’s just been released on parole, he saws off the barrel
of his shotgun and starts training on the local barflies to prepare for
the confrontation with daddy.
Inspired by the “The Playboy of the Western World” by JM Synge,
Sean Brosnan’s first feature is a pretty package of Freudian themes

Hercules) and a producer who is not afraid of Oedipal conflicts, a
certain Pierce Brosnan !"

Imagine two geeks, absolute Trekkies and Whovians, guided by the

of absolutely devastating humor. Nic Costa and Rob Taylor spent
nine years completing this mind-boggling cinematographic oddity.

Sori: Voice from the Heart was directed by Lee Ho-jae (who played in The

time. Rebeca is kidnapped and Virginia meets her maker when she
tries to catch up with the assailants. Luckily God gives Virginia the
right to remain on Earth one more day to save her daughter. But at
sunset, with or without Rebeca, it’s back to the grave. She doesn’t
want to loose a single minute of now infinitely precious time. With the
tenacity of a tiger mum, Virginia starts to track down what appears
to be a supernatural sect. What she discovers would probably have
chilled her blood if she was not already dead. And there’s only one
thing stronger than an occult sect : a mother of a kidnapped child
with nothing left to loose !
The violent and uncompromising script of the brothers Bogliano will
take you on a road where everything is allowed, but nothing is free.
White Coffin takes Argentinean genre cinema to a new level; where
gore is transcended by deeper reflection. Behind the camera, we
find Daniel de la Vega, to whom we already owe Necrophobia 3D.
He leaves the claustrophobic corridors of his previous film behind
for wide open spaces without redemption."

in the sky. Unfortunately, it’s not an eclipse, but an alien spaceship looking for Earthlings to kidnap.
Before his own eyes, Tony sees how his father is sucked into the vessel. Three years later, Sam returns
to Earth. But he’s changed a bit, and that’s putting it mildly.
Thanks to the aid of the young production company New Line (that went on to give us the likes of
Nightmare on Elm Street and Lord of the Rings) Harry Bromley Davenport created a scifi horror gem
that looked as if Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind would have been made by Troma. 25 years after Xtro
terrorized the theaters, the restored version will teach young genre film aficionados that in daddy’s
days they boldly went where horror today does not dare to thread."

2017,edition,"Edito, Edito 2017",,Edito 2017,,,,,"In 1983 everybody thought we were completely
nuts to start with a genre film festival. But we
couldn’t care less. What we wanted was to share
movies you couldn’t see anywhere else with our
friends, movies that found themselves on the
margins of the industry and were sometimes
even looked down upon. But we knew better and
we wanted to infect as many as possible with the
fantastic virus.
With already tens of thousands of visitors at the
very first BIFFF, we quickly realized we had found
a hole in the market. 35 years later we’re browsing
through an old program brochure from 1993
and we’re surprised about what we find in there:
Braindead, Fortress, Reservoir Dogs, Army of Darkness,
Joe Dante’s Matinee… We think “Wow!”
And then we remember how our friend Dario Argento
was crawling on his hands and feet looking
for a car bumper near the Botanique, how Wes
Craven scribbled the idea for The People Under the
Stairs on a napkin in a Brussels’ restaurant, how
mad an already ambitious Luc Besson was when
he didn’t win our Golden Raven with Le Dernier
Combat or Peter Jackson who told us about an
insane project, the adaptation of Tolkien’s Lord of
the Rings. We could go on and on about so many
others (John Landis, Terry Gilliam, Shynia Tsukamoto,
Clive Barker, William Friedkin...). Anecdotes
enough to saturate entire hard drives.
Of course the world has changed in 2017. Cinema
has changed. Fantastic film has finally gotten the
recognition it deserved. But we keep on going.
And with reason! The BIFFF has been an international
reference for a long time and we’ll keep
discovering and supporting the filmmakers of
tomorrow. Just take a look at our program in 25
years and you’ll see that we were wrong to have
been so modest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for a nice commemorative picture.    At the occasion of the BIFFF 2017 and to conclude the ZOMBIFFFday,

thrills.
The program: Rock concerts with Mad Magus and an evening accompanied
by DJ VCTR, who’ll keep the party alive all night long with a
freakishly crazy atmosphere. The fantastic and horror themes will be
present at every moment in a Haunted House atmosphere and a retro
freak show. A unique and immersive experience, thanks to the performance

As an appetizer for the festival, which will take place in June, the
BIFFF rolls out the red carpet for the crime novel on Friday 14 April
at 2 pm in Bozar. Do we still need to accentuate the strength of
the connection between books and movies!? Further proof will be
provided with these three activities:
• The crime novel, an instrument of social protest, with Marin Ledun
and Patrick Raynal, who’s also chairman of the Thriller Jury.
• The crime novel, a powerful weapon of mockery and irony, especially
if Nadine Monfils has a say in it.
• A masterclass with Franck Thilliez and Stéphane Bourgoin.
These meetings will be followed by signing sessions in the crime
library situated in the middle of the BIFFF.
And to end this day in style, the projection at 6pm of the film Will You
Be There?, an adaptation of the novel by Guillaume Musso. Followed

be told through key scenes? As some of his films are anchored in a
specific time and space, while others are not, how does this choice

the picture: the harmonica of Once upon a time in the West, the Halloween
synth, The Pink Panther theme or those few chilling notes
from Psycho or Jaws. But most often, this choice is a tricky process.
Should we use existing music? Should we head for commissioned
music? And in that case, how do we imagine and produce such a
sound universe? In short, an infinity of questions and we’ve got the
people to answer them.
