When he ventures outside, he discovers that London is eerily empty. Stumbling through the silent, abandoned landmarks of the city, he enters a church. There he is attacked by a rabid priest and saved by Selena and Mark, two of the few healthy people still alive. The cynical Selena explains that the virus has spread throughout the country and maybe even the world. Staying alive is as good as it gets. 

After mainstream projects like A Life Less Ordinary and The Beach, director Danny Boyle returns back to basics by delivering a shocking, horrifying and visually stunning take on the end of mankind. The movie draws its inspiration from various sources of popular culture like novels, movies and even television disaster soaps. With an excellent cast, composed of Cillian Murphy, Naomi Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Eccleston and a screenplay by Alex Garland (The Beach), 28 Days Later is a truly scary and memorable viewing experience.

She soon realises that this assignment is more than she bargained for and that a man’s life is in her hands. Putting her own safety into jeopardy, she frantically races to put together the shocking events surrounding Constance’s death, before it’s too late.

Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects, American Beauty) gives another great performance in The Life of David Gale, the new film by celebrated director Alan Parker (Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning, The Commitments). This political thriller does not only tackle the hot issue of the death penalty in the United States, but also deals with loss, fanaticism and redemption. With Kate Winslet (Heavenly Creatures, Quills, Enigma), Laura Linney (The Truman Show, The Mothman Prophecies) and Gabriel Mann (Buffalo Soldiers, The Bourne Identity). "

One of the samurai awakens to find himself miraculously healed. He meets his saviour, a mysterious man who tells him that his friend died from his wounds. The samurai is persuaded to stay the night. His host tells him the legend of the “Tengu”, a goblin which is said to reside in the mountains dining on the flesh of men. He goes on to reveal the true name of the Tengu : Aragami. When the samurai asks if Aragami poses a threat to the temple, his host answers : “I am Aragami”. The only way for the Samurai to leave the temple is to destroy Aragami. 

Modern Japanese action master Ryuhei Kitamura, director of last year’s Versus and this year’s Alive, excites us with Aragami, a non-stop fantastic Samurai sword extravaganza, starring Masayo Kato (Crying Freeman, Godzilla, Brother) as Aragami and Takao Osawa (The Island Tales, All About Lilly Chou-Chou) as the samurai.

Vincenzo Natali, director of the award-winning Cube, is back with a exciting sci-fi story that plays at will with the boundaries between reason and madness, dream and reality. Cypher is a hybrid of different genres but at the same time carefully constructed as a tight, well-thought-out thriller.

Jaume Balaguero, director of our Golden Raven 2000, The Nameless, returns to the festival with his second film, the challenging and ambitious horror story Darkness. Balaguero fully demonstrates his gift for haunting visuals. Skilfully playing with light and shade, he exploits everyone’s fear of the dark coming alive. This big budget horror fest features an attractive, international cast, consisting of Anna Paquin (The Piano), Lena Olin (The Ninth Gate), Iain Glen (Tomb Raider), Giancarlo Giannini (Mimic) and Fele Martinez (Abre los Ojos).

He is terrified, screaming at them to get away before they all die. There are mutilated Germans everywhere, all with terrified expressions on their faces. Something very strange and scary has happened here.  

Just as last year’s Golden Raven, Dog Soldiers, or this year’s 28 Days Later, Deathwatch, by debut director Michael J. Bassett, is another example of the vitality of current British fantasy cinema. Inspired by classics such as The Haunting, Alien and The Thing, Bassett transfers the horror to the trenches of World War I, showing that the old maxim that war is hell can be taken quite literally. With a competent cast, led by Jamie Bell (Billy Elliott) as private Shakespeare and with Hugo Speer (The Full Monthy), Laurence Fox (The Hole) and Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings).   "

M realizes that something is terribly wrong when members of the group are actually transformed into vampires. While investigating the origin of these myths, he finds a way to revert the process. But will M be in time to save their souls ? 

Sangre Eterna, a chilling contemporary vampire story, enjoys an attractive mise-en-scene and elaborate costumes and make-up. The film’s strongest point is the original approach to the vampire genre. Through fantasy elements, we are lured into a psychological terror drama. Sangre Eterna manages to escape classic genre conventions and stands out among current Latin-American cinema. This second feature film of Chilean fantasy aficionado Jorge Olguin (Angel Negro) stars Blanca Lewin (Angel Negro), Juan Pablo Ogalde (Paraiso B) and Carlos Borquez as Dahmer.  "

The Eye is an atmospheric blend of psychological thriller and eerie ghost story by director brothers Danny and Oxide Pang (Bangkok Dangerous). They firmly put the emphasis on spine-tingling suspense and an intriguing storyline, rather than gruesome special effects or blood-splattered excess. The Eye takes its time for the subtle sense of menace to get into top gear, with the most banal moments creating the most unease. The Pang Brothers slowly let the mystery deepen and intensify, until the spectacular ending, which will take the audience by surprise. "

It’s All About Love is a classic love story set in a world on the brink of cosmic collapse by Thomas Vinterberg, the director of internationally acclaimed art house hit The Celebration.

In Eric Valette’s debut long feature Malefique, Evil has found a home between the four walls of a dismal prison. His film builds upon the legacy of old fashioned horror movies and is peopled by oppressive characters, articulated dolls with shining eyes, solid dialogues and a nameless Horror that is slithering between the prisoners’ bunks.

Due to his physical abnormalities, Ulysse has always been pushed aside ever since his childhood. When a strange murder is committed in a nearby village, the peasants inmediately turn their suspicions on Alexandre and Ulysse. In the eyes of the villagers they are demons that must be hunted, burned and killed.

Le Marais is the remarkable long feature debut of Canadian screenwriter-director Kim Nguyen. Fantasy and thriller elements are effortlessly intertwined while the beautiful images of DOP Daniel Vincelette (Caboose, Leaving Metropolis) are continuously drenched in a strange, almost fairytale-like atmosphere. With excellent interpretations from Gregory Hlady (The Red Violin, The Sum of All Fears) and Paul Ahmarani (Rats and Rabbits, Waterfront Dreams) as the social pariah's Alexandre and Ulysse."

Publicly outcast, she believes that her only true friend is the homemade doll given to her by her mother, which she regularly consults for advice. Now that she’s an adult, her deeply rooted scars manifest in vengeful behaviour. May finds herself envying specific body parts of the people she pursues for affection. She begins to unravel after numerous attempts at companionship. The guy she loves dumps her, her lesbian lover cheats on her and her best friend is shattered by selfish school children. With her old doll and best friend destroyed, May has no choice. If you can’t find a friend, make one.

Written and directed by Don Coscarelli, the wicked mind behind the surreal horror of the Phantasm films, Bubba Ho-Tep not only kicks undead ass, but also deals with regret and ultimately finding redemption. Cult-actor Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead) gives a truly inspired performance as the aging Elvis, assisted by the wonderful Ossie Davis (Do The Right Thing) as his wheelchair sidekick.  "

Forget about gothic vampires, Haitian zombies and baroque gore movies and get ready for a horror movie of the 21st century. Director Andrew Parkinson has crafted a truly original film, with a simple, underlying idea. Transpose the old zombie myth to a deliberately realistic setting.

They are simply victims of their own fate. The uncommon approach of making the zombies human, in conjunction with good acting, good script and gorgeous photography makes Dead Creatures an intelligent and original addition to the horror genre.

The stalker also approaches Shigehiko and takes him to a secret club, where he forces him to watch vile and horrible scenes. Who is this man who is throwing the life of this couple in turmoil and what does he want ?

The subject matter of Shinya Tsukamoto’s A Snake of June is sex itself, presented as an awakening for the decaying human body, which must find a stimulus to live life to the fullest. In Tsukamoto’s other films, like Bullet Ballet, Tokyo Fist and Gemini, this awakening is brought on by violence. This time, it comes from within the body itself. A Snake of June, the compelling story of a married couple’s resurrection, enjoys evocative iconographic images, wonderful performances and a strong soundtrack."

It seems that finally the Romulans want to make peace with the Federation and put an end to the centuries old conflict. Once Picard meets with Shinzon, he discovers that the praetor has other things of his mind than peace. In fact he plans to unleash a torrent of secrets, deception and fire power to bring down the Enterprise and his final target, Earth, for good. 

Four years after the latest Star Trek adventure, Insurrection, the Next Generation is back for their final adventure. Star Trek : Nemesis, the tenth installment of the enormously popular franchise, directed by Stuart Baird (Executive Decision, U.S. Marshals) and written by John Logan (Gladiator, The Time Machine), is a lean, mean action adventure, complete with one super villain, a revenge plot and many land and space battles to keep the eyes busy and the fans riveted.

As if this was a trigger, a number of group suicides start taking place throughout Tokyo. Then a woman calls the police and informs them that a web page on the internet is the key to all these incidents. Furthermore, a mysterious child walks up to Detective Kuroda and gives him an advanced warning on the next date and time of a mass suicide. When the police start to stake out the location, an unexpected chain of shocking incidents takes place before their eyes.

Suicide Club starts out as a rampant satire on fads and consumerism, with suicide being just another trend and the blood and scattered body parts as its by-products. But behind this lies a deeper message, transmitted by an audacious and intelligent approach. According to director Sono Sion, the rising suicide rate in Japan is caused by a scarcity of prospects for the future and the loss of identity. People who cannot feel the importance of being alive, can not see the importance of dying. By making this provocative and controversial film, Sono Sion wants his audience to confront this crisis head on. "

Inspector Minks, who led the raid, puts Marc to the choice. Either he works for him in homicide or his career is over. Soon enough, it becomes clear what Mink has in mind. He needs access to a world in which his daughter Marie disappeared into two years ago. Marc’s investigation leads him to the burnt corpse of a young woman and a series of murders, all of which have one thing in common. All the victims are missing large swaths of skin, cut off with a scalpel by the perpetrator. When Marc comes across Maya, the beautiful girlfriend of one of the victims, she too gets sucked into a maelstrom of terror, from which there seems to be no escape.

Set against the backdrop of the techno-club scene, Tattoo is an intense and daring thriller. With his carefully composed, mostly monochrome images, debut-director Robert Schwentke turns Tattoo into a psychologically direct and explicit walk on the wild side that literally gets under your skin. Starring August Diehl (Love : The Hard Way) as Marc, Christian Redl (Oskar and Leni) as Minks and Nadeshda Bernice (Kanak Attack) as Maya. "

While Rosetta struggles with being too shy and timid for her own good, Ruby, Marine and Olive become increasingly independent and “alive”, driven by curiosity, intelligence and desire. 

The vivid and imaginative movie Teknolust, directed and written by Lynn Hershman Leeson (Conceiving Ada), is a coming of age story, not only for the characters, but also of our society‘s relationship to technology. Leeson’s understanding of the far-reaching gender implications of her tale, makes for a wise rethinking of technology’s hazards. With Academy Award winner Hiro Narita (The Arrival) using the latest High-Definition 24P camera, Klaus Badelt (Gladiator, K-19 : The Widowmaker) on the soundtrack and the kind of dazzling art direction rarely seen on indie budgets, Teknolust is one hip cyber-fi movie. Tilda Swinton (Orlando, The Deep End) makes brilliant use of her multiplicity, whirling through the roles of Rosetta, Ruby, Marine and Olive with great gusto. "

Tongan Ninja is a hilarious celebration of action movies, directed and written by Jason Stutter, suitable for musical lovers, sophisticated comedy buffs and devotees of the best Hong Kong action films.

A Tree of Palme could be described as the story of Pinocchio transferred to a world that is equal parts Tolkien and Dante’s Inferno. Director Takashi Nakamura (Catnapped) worked more than ten years on this stunningly beautiful film. He combines impressive 3D backgrounds of a very detailed imaginary world with traditional 2D character design and a spiritual musical score. A Tree of Palme, a feast for the eyes and ears, explores what it means to be human.  "

The friends try to summon his spirit. Using a Jelang­kung, a traditional voodoo doll, to perform the ritual, they get more than they bargained for. The evil spirit will stop at nothing to take its revenge and there seems to be no way out for the four unlucky heroes.         
The Uninvited, shot on digital video for a mere 30.000 US $, is the highest grossing Indonesian feature film ever. This fast paced movie represents independent horror at its best, with plenty of screams, chills and terrifying fun. The two young directors, Jose Poernomo and Rizal Mantovani, both experienced music video makers, use imaginative editing, a highly mobile camera and authentic Javanese folk legends to effectively frighten their young target audience.

In the classrooms, chalk flies like bullets. On the playing fields, students and teacher hang in the air, practicing martial arts against each other. Incidents such as tea leaves becoming the shape of dragons and moving around or windows in the hallway suddenly shattering into bits are not surprising at Volcano High. Then, 108 years after its founding, a stupendous student transfers in. He is Kyung-soo Kim, already expelled from eight schools because he cannot control the power that he is gifted with. He is determined to graduate, no matter what happens. But there are many students eager to challenge the new kid on the block. 

The Korean blockbuster Volcano High is a manic, manga-style mixture of frenzied fight sequences and hysterical comedy that makes Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon look like a relaxed stroll in the park. Director Tae-gyun Kim has given his film a highly stylised baroque background and uses extreme close-ups, slow motion and speeded up action and over-the-top performances to accompany the adrenaline rush of the spectacular magical combats.

Pacto de Brujas was shot in the depths of winter, in small mountain villages. The efforts of cast and crew in the face of freezing temperatures, fierce storms and bitter frost, have achieved a result far above the expected. Pacto de Brujas is a strong contribution to Spanish fantasy, with   an engrossing story where traditional elements of witchcraft are incorporated in a present day rural setting.

They think he will help them become famous and the filmmaker thinks he has found a subject for a film. They are all right, but they will get more than they bargained for.  

Director Petr Zelenka (Buttoners) came up with the idea of making a film starring Czech singer-songwriter Jarek Nohavica and the popular folk band Cechomor when they embarked on a short concert tour in the summer of 2000. Nohavica’s songs, Cechomor’s musical energy and Zelenka’s absurdly comic ideas are combined with concert and backstage footage, interviews with Dutch documentary filmmaker Jan Prent, a guest role for Jaz Coleman of Killing Joke and appearances from other members of the new Czech film wave. Behind the casual nature of the film, lies an unobtrusive sophistication. And Zelenka’s humour, from a discussion of male undergarments to astral presences, is always relentlessly deadpan."

Dick, Timothy Leary, A.G. Ballard, Michael Moorcock and William Burroughs and his experiences with psychedelic drugs, drive him to study psychology, the most literary of human sciences. It’s not long before he discovers his writing talent. Science Fiction is the genre that makes it possible for him to express, in a percussive and humorous style, his reflections on the perversion of power and social violence. We can find these themes in books such as The Men in the Jungle (1967), Bug Jack Barron (1969), The Agent of Chaos (1970), The Iron Dream (1972) and Songs for the Stars (1980). We are very ho­noured to welcome Norman Spinrad as a member of our International Jury. ",,,,,,,,,,Writer,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,name,nm0819004,",,,,,

Two years later, he works with Assayas again in the coming of age drama Late August, Early September.

In the eighties, the mysterious gang of Nivelles brutally killed some 35 people in commando-style raids on supermarkets. They were never caught. Le Bal Masqué brings this period back to life.

Le Bal Masqué wins 3 Joseph Plateau Awards and makes a big impression abroad. This year, his second long feature will hit the theatres.

2003,edition,"Edito, Edito 2003",,Edito 2003,,,,,"Let's be honest: the festivities of our twentieth anniversary left us with an upset stomach and quite a headache. To cut short: one could easily have been discouraged.
But the quality of the products that have caught our eyes, kicked us back into gear. And here we are, on the verge of a Festival we think is even better and, to be honest, maybe the most beautiful of all the ones we could have organised.
For a trend has become heavily obvious. A trend we haven't seen for a long time: two of the most emblematical sub genres of Fantasy Film, Horror and Science Fiction, are making a strong come-back. Almost half of the whole selection belongs to these categories. Do we have before us a barely deformed mirror of our daily fears ? Is this a reflection of the current gloomy mood on our planet ? We certainly aren't complaining about it.
The other trend of this year, maybe less spectacular, but nonetheless worthy of being revealed, is a quality extension of the Fantastic genre on the global film map. Chile (Sangre Eterna), Thailand (Body Jumper, Killer Tattoo, The Eye), Indonesia (The Uninvited) and even India (Patalghar) rejoin the circle, that is finally taking on the shape of the FPC (Fantastic Producing Countries). And we top it off with a bunch of French flicks, not ashamed to knock on the doors of the big ones (four movies in our selection this year). 
Finally, even though we are the ones to point out the phenomenon, it is always good to remind the fact that Spain has become one of the centres of Fantasy gravity. Through the focus dedicated to the Filmax International production house (4 movies in our program) we pay homage to one of the most prolific providers of genre cinema. A house that, let's not forget this, has managed to attract overseas directors who found, under the Barcelona sun, the conditions they couldn't find anymore in a Hollywood only concerned with mega-budgets. 
To end, just some figures : 21 feature films will be presented in world or international premiere, 16 in European premiere. Once again, almost half our program. We told you, there's no reason to complain.

2003,event,Workshop,,"8th Workshop ""Brussels Fantastic""",,,,,"They already have their cameras on the shoulder and are ready to render the Capital even more fantastic than it already is. Students from the Rits and Narafi film schools will be given the duration of the festival to shoot and edit 3 short films, which will be presented to the public of the Passage 44 on Friday March 28th at 17:00 (free screening).
As for each year, they will be provided with professional equipment and staff, from the students of Jean-Pierre Finotto’s make-up school to numerical editing consoles, provided by the special digital effects company Cine & Fx.
A renowned director will be helping them in their task during shooting and editing. A scenario week-end has already taken place in early February, where the last corners of the scripts have been softened.
South African director Richard Stanley has taken up the challenge to conduct this year’s operations. As director of two cult films par excellence – Hardware and Dust Devil – Stanley has gained a reputation among underground film buffs, thanks to his bizarre imagery that commentators sometimes compared to the style of Dario Argento. But this reputation didn’t prevent him from experiencing harsh relationships with the heads of the Hollywood studios, who were for the least disappointed not to find in him the gentle rip-off maker they were looking for. Ultimately, this situation lead to his eviction from the set of “The Island of Dr. Moreau” that Stanley was due to direct. His vision of Wells’ novel, of which he intended to render the cruel and baroque atmosphere, frightened the producers to the point that he was laid off after 4 days of shooting.
Finally, thanks to United International Pictures, one student will be sent to London, where he’ll be able to follow the Short Course Unit of the NFTS (National Film & Television School).

After only one year of existence, the next-gen consoles have already provided us with tremendous games, if not
with real masterpieces. While on the field of the PC, some hugely awaited games have finally made it to the
shelves. To put it shortly, both our Juries must surely have to cope with serious headaches to select the finalists
of this year and the games that landed in these lists can surely consider themselves lucky, as the competition
was tough.

lovers of Fantastic Cinema, almost exclusively thanks to the impulse of
the production company of Julio Fernandez, Filmax, and its branches
Fantastic Factory and Discovery. In a few years the company has
managed to gather a collection of solid talents (Jaume Balaguero,
Nacho Cerda, ...) and even to attract directors from over the Ocean like
Brian Yuzna, Jack Sholder and Stuart Gordon. The festival, thus, has
decided to pay homage to the Barcelonian production house, which
has made a great start, at the borders of the Mediterranean Sea, to fill
the void left with the disappearance of Hammer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between dreams and nightmares 
The illustrations of Fabrice are an invitation for a journey through a bizarre and sombre universe, peopled by strange characters. He has developed a disturbing fantasy aesthetic wherein his creations mutate into impressionable matter. 
A broken puppet with a remarkably human anatomy, a man with a cracked stone skin, the tattooed woman with the death look,… 
They propose us, almost despite ourselves, to follow them into their troubled and ambiguous world, leaving behind the strange impression of a dream that one thought to have forgotten. 
His work functions like a mirror, revealing our fears and phantasms. 
Born in Paris in 1969, Fabrice comes to Brussels in 1991 to follow Plastic Arts studies at the Saint Luke Institute. This ex-artistic director of Science-Fiction Magazine, colourist, graphic designer and above all illustrator, has realised numerous covers of fantasy novels.
