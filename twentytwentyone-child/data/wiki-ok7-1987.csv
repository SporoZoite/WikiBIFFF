Getting their car stuck in the mud in the middle of nowhere will probably not bring back the peace between Mr. and Mrs. Bower… They will thankfully find refuge in the house of two lovely and (maybe too?) thoughtful elders. The two elders are fond of their dolls and own an impressive collection, with dozens of porcelain characters, well arranged and motionless, apparently staying still, apparently filled with innocence… 
The guests of the old couple are past the age of playing with dolls, yet the dolls truly seem to want to play with the guests and their games will be far less innocent than those played by little girls…


 Almost produced at the same time as “From Beyond” in the Roman studios of Empire Pictures, “Dolls” is a smart, carefully crafted movie with no downtime, irrefutably showing that Stuart Cordon, a guest from the 4th edition of the festival, is a brilliant director. Far from the Lovecraft fever of his “Re-Animator” and “From Beyond”, his new movie tells an interesting, macabre story where he shows that he has perfectly assimilated the tropes of traditional horror. This beautiful story, in which angelic rhymes with horrible, comes from the screenwriter Ed Naha (“Ghoulies II”, “Spellcaster”)."

Follow me with the utmost attention: traumatized by what he had gone through, Tommy Jarvis was hallucinating and EVERYTHING that happened in “Friday the 13th Part 5: A New Beginning” was only in his head. So let’s set the record straight: the plot resumes where the 4th movie ended. In between the movies, Tommy has grown up and wants to make sure that Jason has indeed been buried.
Against all odds, THERE IS something that makes this movie stand out from the previous ones: its scenario! Written by Tom McLoughlin, who directed the astonishing “One Dark Night”, “Friday the 13th Part 6” does not fall into the absurd conventions of the genre that had since then been used in this murderous trek for teenagers. It is completely innovating and gives a dramatic and humoristic intensity to its subject and main character, characteristics which were clearly missing from the previous movies. “Without any concession to gratuitous horror, ‘Friday the 13th: Jason Lives’ conveys a violence that has hardly ever been equaled. Armed with an imagination and a talent as sharp as his hero’s favorite blade, Tom McLoughlin used audacity, (dark) humor and rigor to give us the best movie of this series, and it might not be the last.” (C. Karani)"

For a while, their universe will only consist of documents stored in the shelter: a collection of detective movies and music from the ’40s. Living this way for fifteen years leaves marks: they wear Borsalinos and caps, speak like Humphrey Bogart and named themselves Phillip and Marlowe—and when they finally manage to get out of the shelter, their heads are filled with curvy blonde girls, pretty yet dangerous (they have never seen a woman before), and they are going to discover the outside world with “private eyes”.
They are going to have a run for their patience: a pretty blonde girl will push them into a terrible adventure where disco mutants will do them no more favors than the hippie cannibals and masters of the punk district.
Humor and madness are the words for this “detective rock story” in a weird post-nuclear word, directed and written by Pyun-Karnowski.John Stockwell (Phillip) is far from being unknown: he played “Dennis” in John Carpenter’s “Christine” and also starred in Aaron Lipstadt’s “City Limits” and Jonathan Betuel’s “My Science Project”. Miles, the young girl who will “introduce” our two heroes to the “fascinating” post-nuclear world is played by Lisa Blount, also known for her roles in “An Officer and a Gentleman”, “Cut and Run” and “What Waits Below”.

Only child for almost 35 years, John is confused. But when his mother asks him in a roundabout way that he promises to destroy that brother, he is on the verge of distress! The thing is, his mother was an honorable biologist who won the American Nobel Prize of genetics alongside another Doctor, Dr. Philip Lloyd… in whom confused John will confide, even though Dr. Lloyd and his mother had not been getting along for a while. John will slowly understand the crazy dream that both scientists have never stopped following, the reasons of their argument, and slip into the nightmare…
“Horror really is put at the center in ‘The Kindred’, one of the best independent works of the season. Directed by Jeffre Obrow and Stephen Carpenter (‘The Power’), this film has all of the qualities that thrill-seeking fans are looking for: an innovative theme, un-growing suspense, a steady rhythm, a careful staging and special effects as effective as wild from Michael McCraken (‘The Twilight Zone’, ‘Poltergeist’, ‘Silver Bullet’).”
The independent production industry had not offered such an amazing surprise since the terrifying “House” (Ecran Fantastique)

“As sete vampiras” is the first South-American movie that the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival will screen.
If such numerous and cosmopolite fantastic movies are being screened to a Brazilian public fond of that genre Brazil, unlike other South American nations, has few directors who specialized in the genre. Only the name of Joé Mogica Marins, whose films are considered there as important as the ones of Universal and Hammer, is associated with it.
And that is the name that Ivan Cardoso, director of “As sete vampiras”, is taking credits for. His movie “The Secret of the Mummy”, which was already a respectful yet really enjoyable parody, has won four awards in Brazil. 
He sees the fantastic as a quintessential poetic genre."

That is actually what he is convinced of: a successful professional life, a wonderful girlfriend, everything that makes life heaven on earth and that we never know we will reach when we grow up. But the day a noble man played by Peter Cushing comes to his house to ask him if nothing extraordinary has happened to him right before checking his watch to notice that it is… missed meeting, Jim is suddenly carried in the middle of WWI and well, of course, that’s the end of the sweet life he had been living!
“The final gag will not be the least of the surprises that this movie has in store for us. It was directed by John Hough, the director of ‘The Watcher in the Woods’ and mostly of the great ‘Incubus’. Starting off with an original beginning to the classical time-traveling genre, he has created an action movie which evolves between pure fantasy, burlesque and spectacular. All of this is brought with control of the situations and the characters which are a master’s work. The action goes from the very beginning to the very end of the movie. We smile, we live, we take part in the movie. ‘Biggles’ is one of those neat movies which easily shows their pictures to the audience without no other choice but for them to be complicit, only to let them be surprised and realize afterwards how complex the movie they have just watched is.

The two emerging canines will definitely not help him fit in, and through his tragic destiny he will only dream of fully becoming something else… for our own pleasure, because “Something Else” is neither a Greek tragedy about the meaning of life and death or a horror movie. It is a (yes, slightly bloody but humoristic) satire where the three main actors perfectly caricature our society: neither the church, the army or the administration will escape their caustic humor. And that is how we get a movie that (might) fully be something else… 
Directed by Morten Jolstad, this Dracula-like comedy is starring three famous actors from Norway: Trond Kirkvaag, Knut Lystad and Lars Mjoen, winners of the Rose d’Or at Montreux a few years ago."

But first, they need to be “initiated” and A.J. has the “greatest idea ever” just before the test gets too “boring”: they are going to find a strip-teaser who will perform during the “induction” ceremony of the club.
Now they are on their way to the “After Dark Club” (where the hottest girls can be found, according to the review) with Duncan, whose car they are borrowing. Quickly seated in the dark, among the purple lights of the nightclub, they immediately notice a dancer, Katrina, who is starting her show and making quite the impression on them. A.J. hurries backstage and is brought to Katrina. 
To him, she’s an amazing girl who will help him out; to her, he’s yet another goon who came here so that she can get a taste… of his blood! 
For his first movie, screenwriter and director Richard Wenk got lucky: after her brilliant interpretation of a wildling in “Conan II” and her role as the troubling May Day in “A View to a Kill”, Grace Jones plays Katrina, unforgettable in her role as a seductive vampire.
The other actors are no strangers either: we have Chris Makepeace (“The Falcon and the Snowman”) starring as Keith and Robert Rusler (“Weird Science”, “Nightmare on Elm Street II, ‘Trashin’) starring as A.J."

“Night of the Creeps” does not stay in the ‘50s for too long. We quickly jump into the ‘80s and meet Chris Romero, J.C. Hooper, Cynthia Cronenberg, Brad Craven and many more…
You must have guessed it, this night drowns in private jokes. It is a tribute to the fantastic genre, from the old-fashioned science fiction of the ‘50s to the recent (and bloody) Core.
With “Night of the Creeps” Fred Dekker, screenwriter and director who was already behind the great “House” is giving us his first movie. As needed, he surrounded himself with renowned actors and workers: David Miller (“Nightmare on Elm Street”) was in charge of the special effects, Jason Lively (“Brainstorm”, “National Lampoon's European Vacation”) plays Chris Romero and Tom Atkins (“Creepshow”, “The fog”, “Escape from New York” ) plays Ray Cameron."

Piotr Szulkin, the director of “Ga-ga”, is well known at the festival: he came here himself in ’86 to screen his latest movie “O-Bi, O-Ba: The End of Civilization”, which was selected to compete that year.
We had enjoyed his talent at directing actors, his keen sense of directing (even though the means were clearly lacking) and his sharp personality as an engaged screenwriter and director.

One day, on the brink of winter, a woman gets off the train here by mistake. The train leaves and is only coming back in a year. She is pretty, she is wearing luxurious clothes and the pointsman does not speak her tongue. To our man, she is an extraterrestrial, an E.T. light years away from her home.
To simple man who never questioned himself, this woman is dangerous and what seems to be a simple dream at first will turn into a nightmare. The signaler’s paradise becomes a moist, rotten shipwreck filled with woodlice.
The cinematographic press has been praising “The Illusionist” by calling it the director’s best movie, and it seems fair. “The Pointsman”, which is coming out three years later”, could overthrow it. “Jos Stelling is an incredible film-maker, ‘The Pointsman’ is a parable that touches everyone and brings us back to something we needed” (Mad Movie). “Spreading like burnt matches on the snow, the lunar characters from ‘The Pointsman’ are immediately fascinating. It is a rare movie.” (Starfix)"

If some of them are desperately resisting, the young Locra decides to run away from this totalitarian universe. Followed by Kid, his robotic teacher, he has 48 hours to steal a spaceship that will get him somewhere else… 
Do not be surprised if this story and its settings remind you of “Star Wars”. In 1978 the director, Roger Christian, won an Oscar for his work as a stage designer for George Lucas’ movie. He has also worked for Ridley Scott on “Alien” and a role as second unit director was waiting for him on the set of “Legend” if he had not preferred “Starship”—a movie for which he would be the full director after having written the scenario with Matthew Jacobs. They are offering an Orwell-like story, convincingly played by Australian actors with, among others, Hugh Keyes-Byrne the “toecutter” from “Mad Max 1”.We owe the soundtrack to Toni Banks (from Genesis) and can hear some songs from Peter Gabriel."

Fred is as happy there as he would be anywhere, but Kevin is dying to rejoin “normal” society” and to live a decent life: that causes friction between the two.
Yet they will have to get along to solve some problems that are tarnishing their lives: we have the former G.I ., group leader, who resents them… because he hates everyone by principle, the vile Schnizer who wants to remove them from their junkyard, Nick Duran who hates Fred because he “borrowed” his girlfriend… and then, there’s this gut-wrenching “Viper”, and time has given it an acid strength as well as explosive properties! 
We have gore movies, but we also have trash movies: Hershell Cordon. Lewis, Russ Meyer and John Waters are the masters of the genre, “Manic” and “Basket Case” by Frank Henenlotter are examples of it.
“Street Trash”, directed by Jim Muro (21), is trash: it adds various but garish colors to the red of the gore genre. Fireworks of feelings, blood and colorful fluids, it has the look of a special number of “Zoom” on the Bronx though and is directed with a certain brilliance. “Colors that overlap just like traveling with sharp turns, pushed against each other by an insane process of editing. The mutations are the work of Jennifer Aspinall, a young woman whose work has already been seen in ‘Toxic’”. (Starfix)"

At the end of the line (from the other side): his late father.
Roland Emmerich, the German producer, director and screenwriter, signs his second feature film with “Joey”. “The Noah’s Ark Principle” revealed him as the most Spielberg-like German screenwriter and “Joey” reinforces the idea. It is a fantastic story directed with great means, neat and convincing and helped with authentic special effects. This German movie done the American way is carried by the young Joshua Morrel, who plays the loveable young boy with the perfect blend of conviction and innocence required for the role."

But not all experiments turn out the way we expect them to…
This out-of-the-atomic-and-computer-area Frankenstein, which was one of the greatest surprises during the last Cannes Festival, is way closer to the invincible and indestructible “Terminator” robot than to the good old monster created by Mary Shelley. His journey is the one of the invulnerable, and nothing and no one will be able to get in the way of him pursuing the ones he wishes to get revenge on. Only a few crumbs of feelings will act as a barrier in front of the homicidal fury of that destroying monster."

All of these stories are haunting Rosaleen’s dreams: her nights are becoming quite strange, terrifying things are happening and handsome, fearless men are the heroes of these stories…
Little by little, those dreams are going to turn into reality…
Neil Jordan, the director, is first and foremost one of the most skilled writers of his generation: his first collection of stories, “A Night in Tunisia”, has been adapted for television. His first movie “Angel” received a great critical and public response and “The Company of Wolves” revealed him as an extremely talented poet and director.
Christopher Tuckers, guest during our 3rd edition, was in charge of the special effects in terms of makeup: considered as one of the best specialists in his field (he worked on “Dune”, “Star Wars”, “Elephant Man”), his contribution to the work is priceless.

Nancy Thomson has always had sweet dreams. Obviously: she lives a respectable life as a spoiled girl in a charming Californian town, and it is quite easy for her to have good grades—yet, studies are not what will prevent her from going out with her friends, boys and girls!
And then, all of a sudden, her dreams are becoming unpleasant: they are about being followed by a maniac whose hands are made of long metal claws. In the morning, phew, he’s gone… but the marks and tears on her clothes aren’t! Nancy will soon have to learn how to survive her dreams…
Wes Craven (“Deadly Blessing”, “The Last House on the Left”, “The Hills Have Eyes”) shows violence as it truly is: too painful, shocking and deeply human.
In his movies, killers aren’t monsters but human beings. To him, “Horror is a brutal intrusion of violence into our daily reality, a violence that had been lying dormant, eagerly waiting for the right moment to wake up and throw itself upon us!” 
Jim Doyle, special effects supervisor but physicist by training, is a newcomer in the field. Yet, if we’re to trust “Nightmare”, it seems as if he has already mastered it (movies such as “Wargames” and even “One From the Heart” already appear on his “scoreboard”)."

The droids C-3PO and R2-D2 are taken in by the young Luke Skywalker who takes up the cause of the rebels… and the Princess.
Georges Lucas (“THX 1138”, “American Graffiti”) claimed when Star Wars came out that he “I wanted to do a modern fairy tale, a myth, because young people don't have a fantasy life any more. All they've got is Kojak and Dirty Harry. Since the Western genre has gone out of style, they don’t have a mythological ‘space’ any more. I wanted to give them one. Young people are way more sophisticated than we were, but they are bored. I think that when they go to the movie theater, they want to see something: the reason I'm making Star Wars is that I want to give young people some sort of faraway exotic environment for their imaginations to run around in.”
He was not wrong: “Star Wars” has become one of the biggest successes in the history of movies!

“The Empire Strikes Back” is definitely the best episode of the trilogy, which ended with “The Return of the Jedi”. It was directed by Irvin Kershner (“Never Say Never Again”). 
Actually, in the mind of Lucas—who produced and oversaw the special effects in the movie, “Star Wars” is just the first step of a greater project which should lead, in about twenty years or so, to a series of nine movies divided in three trilogies. In ten years, we notice see the improvement of special effects even more than in the first movie. “2001: A Space Odyssey”, the pioneer movie, only included 35 shots using special effects. In 1977, “Star Wars” already had 380. “The Empire Strikes Back” incorporated 722 shots like these which was, according to Kershner, “the limit of what can be done in this field”."

With “The Return of the Jedi”, Lucas put an end to the main trilogy of a modern fairy tale, but he is also living one. The success of the 3 episodes placed him at the head of a growing financial empire and he has worked on different projects. He has worked with Spielberg on “Raiders of the Lost Ark”, he has directly supported younger directors such as Lawrence Kasdan and John Korty and has created a thinking center for the directors and screenwriters who want to work independently from Hollywood. That is besides his “Industrial Light and Magic”, one of the most creative American visual effects companies, where he started research to improve editing and mixing techniques through electronics.

“Amityville”, which is the adaptation of a book based on true events, was directed by Stuart Rosenberg (“Cool Hand Luke”, “Pocket Money”), the well-known Hollywood producer who managed to create an oppressive and nightmarish climate in the movie.

However, his biggest concern will be to get back to... the present. There is one issue, though: panicked while leaving, he forgot the spare fuel canister!
Since Robert Zemeckis was seen as an “unlucky” director because his first two movies “Crazy Day” and “Used Car” were a failure, it took him four years to convince producers to care about “Back to the Future”.
Only Spielberg was interested. Knowing that his third movie “Romancing the Stone” made the headlines and that producers finally started caring about Zemeckis, it seemed obvious for him to entrust Spielberg with its production… and he did not have to regret it!

Roger Corman took advantage of the uneasiness and discomfort left by “Jaws” for this production through a well-built script and an efficient directing which never waver.
Joe Dante (“The Howling”, “The Twilight Zone”), who is directing for the first time, insidiously built a sense of panic which only grows higher until it reaches a violent terror.

Fiercer, angrier and more destructive than ever, just like a relentless killing machine, Conan is back on new adventures, driven by a thirst for the absolute and a despair so intense it makes him believe he can beat Death itself!
“If Millius gave us a mystical and powerful Conan that he was far from the original work, Richard Fleischer (‘Fantastic Voyage’, ‘Soylent Green’) went for a version that is as close as possible to Howard’s work. He directed a pure action movie, going back to his roots (‘The Vikings’) where humor is prominent. 
Arnold Schwarzenegger (‘Terminator’) assesses his comedian work by playing a stone-faced character whose eye (burning with rage or aghast with the effects of magic) and jaw, firm and determined, betray the incredible mobility that makes his incredible musculature.” (C.

Douglas Trumbul, who was revealed as a brilliant engineer with “2001: A Space Odyssey” and a sensitive, creative director with “Sileni Running”, put aside the space opera to get closer to mankind and its most genuine concerns in “Brainstorm”. 
 With the help of an extremely well-built script, he explored all the implications of such a discovery and created a truly well-done story funny at times, pathetic most of the time."

However, Rosemary’s pregnancy is not looking good: ironically, she is losing weight and is having horrible nightmares.
With “Rosemary’s Baby”, Roman Polanski (“The Tenant”, “Macbeth”) had renewed the involvement of the devil in human lives. Created as a thriller with a supernatural twist, his movie is also a satire of the pseudo-religious hysteria of several American people. Sadly, reality had to confirm this vision."

“Re-Animator”, an adaptation of Lovecraft’s novel, is Stuart Gordon’s first movie. Since then, he has given us “From Beyond” and “Dolls”, which made its world premiere at the festival.
One of the many critics: “It is a gut-wrenching movie, to the point that it is surely going to give you a liver failure. Even with the first retching that predicted stronger nausea through the movie, up until the point of finally throwing up, we cannot keep our eyes off it.

Tobe Hooper (“The Chainsaw Massacre”, “Poltergeist”), a filmmaker particularly fond of the demoniac, the craziness and the cruelty, directed his sixth feature film with “Life Force”. Despite a commercial failure, this lyrically powerful and evocative movie is nonetheless an outstanding work in terms of fantastic films.
Dan O’Bannon (screenwriter for “Alien” and director of the great “The Return of the Living Dead”) and Don Jacoby drew inspiration from a Colin Wilson novel (“The Space Vampires”) and John Dykstra (“Star Wars”, “Startrek”, “Outland”) worked on the very well-made special effects."

To fix this failure and make this monster more human, the scientist is about to give him a “bride”: Eva.
Singer-songwriter Sting is undoubtedly Dr. Frankenstein as pictured by Mary Shelley: young, pretty and distinguished. However, he has already proven (in “Dune” and “Quadrophenia”) that he could perfectly play the most arrogant and frightening characters! 
“The Bride”, directed by Franc Roddam (“The Lords of Discipline”) actually advocates for women’s rights: “What I enjoy doing in my movies is talking about people who go against the established order and fight to survive. I believe in heroes —even when they lose, they have somehow won.”"

With “Duel”, Steven Spielberg made a sensational debut in the world of moviemaking. Ever since then, we have stopped counting his success as director (“Close Encounters of the Third Kind”, “E.T.”) and producer (“Poltergeist”).
Yet alongside “1941”, “Duel” might be his most successful work. Way less childish and good-natured than the rest of his works, “Duel” is a true nerve-wracking movie where Spielberg does not speculate on the audience’s naivety. 
Initially shot for television but screened in movie theaters, “Duel” owes a lot to its screenwriter Richard Matheson."

Loosely and “iconoclasticly” based on the well-known poem from the author who wrote “Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque”, Roger Corman (“The Fall of the House of Usher”, “The Masque of the Red Death”, “The Haunted Palace”) and his old friend and screenwriter Richard Matheson are going for a parody. 
The story is (too!) simple, but it stars three well-known actors that are as rogue as their careers. We have Boris Karloff, who has worked a lot in the horror genre since “Frankenstein”, Vincent Price and a mocking stare on his British, gentleman face and Peter Lorre, even greater than when he played in “M” and “The Maltese Falcon”. The three of them happily go above and beyond, obviously respecting the original script only once in a while.

“If there was someone who should have been worried about his future, it had to be Tobe Hooper. After the failure of ‘Lifeforce’ in ’85 and the bigger failure of ‘Invaders from Mars’ in ’86, ‘The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2’ was all he had left to win back the public!
Let there be no doubt: the movie does not only give us what we wanted, it goes even further when it comes to horror, excess and satire!
First of all, the horror, a field where Tom Savini really outdid himself to such an extent that the movie had to be censored three times.
Then, the excess. This time, the bloodthirsty madmen (including Leatherface who, just like the Beast, will fall in love with a Beauty) are facing an even madder character: Dennis Hopper (“Blue Velvet”, “Easy Rider”, “Apocalypse Now”).
Finally, the satire thanks to L.M. Kit Carson (screenwriter of “Paris-Texas”) who seems to have had a field day and stomped on the good manners and moral principles of the American consumer society. The Texas killers became actual gastronomy entrepreneurs and are not only well known in the region for their savory chili—which everyone would like to find the recipe to—but they also own an amusement park, some kind of completely crazy “Ramboland”!
Thankfully for Hopper, ‘The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2” is a success, well on its way to become, twelve years after the first movie, a new cult movie.

He is a maniac who is responsible for a series of murders and his bad reputation has earned him a one-way ticket to the nearest mental institution. A troupe of actors has decided to draw a musical inspired by the mischiefs of Wallace. Locked up in a theater under the pouring rain, they start rehearsing and are soon joined by an unusual actor: Wallace himself! 
“Aquarius” is the first movie of one of Argento’s assistants. Michele Soavi worked on “Tenebrae”, “Phenomena” and “Demons” before paying tribute to his master in “Dario Argento’s World of Horror”, a documentary that he fully directed.
In “Aquarius”, Soavi goes back to Argento’s first cinematic love: the giallo, a horrific thriller with a splash of fantasy. “Aquarius” is thus one of these stories about a psychopathic killer which are dear to Italian movie makers.
Argento did not produce this movie, but Joe D’Amato (“Anthropophagus”, “Blue Holocaust”) did. Aesthetically, “Aquarius” does look like a movie from Argento but we can also notice the influence of D’Amato with a hand drill going through someone’s stomach and a strong arm going through a wooden door to grab the victims hiding behind it."

Do not worry, pretty young children: these rats, this rat, is only a man, Gunther the peeper, Gunther the crawler who is stalking you, and knows your deepest secrets. But recommend your soul to God: Gunther is much more dangerous than a rat—he finds evil, pain and death fascinating…
Far from the ardent passion of “The Seduction” or the wild, cruel, romantic “Tourist Trap”, “Crawlspace”—which marks the comeback of David Schmoeller as director in horror movies—is not recommended for claustrophobic people. Full of great findings and interesting plot twists, it is one of the rare movies that uses horror to remind us what Nazi horror was like.

It is some kind of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde when it comes to feelings.” (Jean Marboeuf) Once again, the director Jean Marboeuf (“Vaudeville”) asserts his love for the absurd and sweet human feelings in “Grand Guignol”. “The special effects of the movies are not intended to the salacious and sadistic audience that we can see in drive-ins.

He even worked with Woody Allen as a screenwriter on “Take the Money and Run” and “Bananas”, and as an actor in “Broadway Danny Rose”. With this hilarious comedy where the actors themselves seem to be having fun, he turns out to be a really skilled director. The lovely Lauren Hutton plays a very “glamorous” vampire—it is her modeling career that pulled her towards an acting career, and the famous “Harper’s Bazaar” magazine has even crowned her the Most Beautiful Woman in the World!
We have seen her as an actress in “American Gigolo”, “All Fired Up” and “A Wedding” by Altman."
1987,movie,,,DEAD OF WINTER,Arthur Penn,1987,USA,Belgian Premiere,,"Mary Steenburgen, Roddy McDowall, Jan Rubes",,,,,,,100',"Drama, Horror, Thriller ",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0092842,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1",,,,,"For such a young, ambitious actress like Katie McGovern, the audition she has been offered is the chance of her life. She has to replace a comedian who has just given up on shooting a movie.
Soon enough, Katie finds herself hundreds of kilometers away from home, in a Victorian house far from everything. His host, Dr. J. Lewis, is a charming man who is stuck in a wheelchair. He is the one who will shoot the young girl’s audition.
With the help of the skilled Mr. Murray, Dr. Lewis’ obedient assistant, Katie slowly changes, resembling the actress she has replaced so much so that they could be mistaken.
We cannot really say that the director Arthur Penn (“The Left Handed Gun”, “The Missouri Breaks”, “Alice’s Restaurant”) is a pro when it comes to fantastic movies, but this pessimist painter of a society which can only find solutions by means of violence has never half depicted the horror of such violence. Let’s take the “execution” of “Bonnie and Clyde” for example, or the massacre of the Indians in “Little Big Man”. It is with movies such as these that people like Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman or Jack Nicholson finally reached their level of stardom.
Mary Steenburgen (“Ragtime”, “A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy”, “Crosscreek”) has offered us a lasting memory with “Time After Time” and stars with her usual talent as Katie McGovern."

In order to benefit from isolating condition favorable to his inspiration, the writer retires to an ancestral home in Wales, which has been uninhabited for more than 40 years.
After settling there, the young man starts to write. Then begins a really long night where humor will fight against horror…
Using a heavy atmosphere of mystery and dark poetry, this movie deserves credits for reuniting, for the first time ever on the big screen, the 4 greatest glories of the fantasy genre.
Peter Cushing, John Carradine, Christopher Lee and Vincent Price bestow upon this production, for which they all received the Best Actor award at the Stiges Film Festival, the status of genuine cinematic event."

To run away from these persecutions, the young mouse Fievel and his family flee to the United States where, in their heads, “there are no cats” and “streets are paved with cheese”.
“An American Tail” is the first animated movie directed by Spielberg and second movie by Don Bluth, after “The Secret of NIMH”. Fievel Monsekewitz and his family are newcomers in the world of animated movies, just like their voice actors (including Don De Luise and Christopher Plummer). They received a positive response from the American press: “Mr. Bluth has rediscovered the beauties to be found in the so-called old-fashioned animation techniques used by Walt Disney in [his] classics.” (New York Times), “a poignant and cheerful story” (Movieline) etc."
1987,movie,,,PROGRAMMED TO KILL,Allan Holzman,1987,USA,World Premiere,,"Robert Ginty, Sandahl Bergman, James Booth",,,,,,,91',"Science-Fiction, Action ",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0093790,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0",RETALIATOR,,,,"Terrorists kill, hijack, kidnap… nothing and no one seems to be able to stop them… besides the CIA?
The CIA seems to have found a way to counter the terror by kidnapping the beautiful yet savage Samira, kidnapped by former secret agent Eric Mathew. This kidnapping will let them attempt their little experience. They hand her over to a specialized laboratory and put it in charge of making her a deadly puppet whose strings will be in their hands. The operation is a success and soon enough, Samira wreaks havoc among her former terrorist friends.
But Samira turns out to be a double-edged sword in the hands of the CIA…
Sandahl Bergman stars as Samira. She started as a dancer on Broadway and, after playing in “All that Jazz” and “Xanadu”, she caught the eye in “Conan the Barbarian” in which her sculptural beauty made her the perfect match for Arnold Schwarzeneger, and she also starred in “Red Sonja”.
Robert Cinty stars as Eric Mathews. He started as a rock musician (he played with Janis Joplin, Carlos Santana and Jimmy Hendrix) and headed towards classical theater, TV and finally, movies. We have seen him in “Coming Home” but his biggest achievements were “The Exterminator”, “The Alchemist” and “The Warrior of the Lost World”.
Allan Holzman, the director, comes from the Corman team for which he directed, among others, “Firecracker” and “Mutant”. "

But once chased by the owners of the disk, Quint hides it in the trunk of a stunning car, a piece of art and technological marvel developed by three Texans who named it “Black Moon”. Quint follows the car to Los Angeles but Nina, head of a car-stealing gang whose brain is the dangerous Ryland, gets hold of the prototype which is then hidden in the lair of Ryland, a glass tower and real fortress where no one can break in… 
With “Black Moon Rising”, a movie closer to a thriller than to science fiction, the director Carpenter (“Christine”, “Starman”, “Escape from New York”) shows once again that, before being a talented director, he is mostly an extremely effective screenwriter.
Set in a (really) near future, this story has been conducted really efficiently by Harley Cokliss (“Battletrucks”, which was granted the Jury Prize at the Festival international du film fantastique d’Avoriaz in ’83 and was screened during the 1st festival) and interpreted by Rommy Lee Jones, Linda Hamilton and Robert Vaugh (“Demon Seed”, “Brass Target”)"

They live in a society ruled by an Eco Protectorate who has its hands on all of the water of a parched earth. They play skate ball, a violent game, against a team named the Scorpios, funded by a horrible man named Strictor Grock.
During a fight which followed a game Daniel (little Lukas Haas from “Witness”), the mascot of the “Solarwarrios”, comes across a shiny, magical object: the Bodhi. He decides to keep it but quickly loses it…
And that is how, by looking for the Bodhi—which could actually hold the power to overthrow the Protectorate—while being hunted down by Grock and his minions, the “Solarwarriors” dive into the adventure … on rollers! 
A desert-like future, a group of kids, a deadly game, “Solarwarriors” has everything yet nothing to do with “Mad Max”, “The Goonies” and “Rollerball”, and it is Irene Walzer's first work for the Brooks Film (“Elephan Man”, “France”, “The Fly”). It is indeed Mel Brooks (“Young Frankenstein”, “The Producers”) who asked Alan Johnson to produce the movie, starting from a visual idea from Douglas Metrov. With the solid screenplay built from something abstract, we are given a movie with heart, innocence and magic."

This is why he is going to meet with Max Holst, a brain surgeon, who can help him succeed by means of a tricky surgery. However, Holst sees Steinmetz as a dangerous madman and refuses to perform the surgery. An incredible standoff will then begin between the two men. After prodigiously focusing Steinmetz, who cannot convince the surgeon, will manage to create a doppelganger of the man who refuses to help him. A spectrum, a perfect twin who is smarter and more skilled than his original copy. 
The doppelganger will progressively take Holst place. Holst is nothing: does he still exist?

It’s the Great Depression: unemployment and the plague are spreading in the city. Well, the Great Depression is spreading across Europe too. The young man meets a former friend who will suggest that he take up residence in an abandoned bank, but only for a night or two.
He goes into the sewers and once he has arrived at the place, he hears music: it is a banquet and men with rat-shaped faces are dancing around a table. The guests are praising their “savior” and find out that the young man is here, so he runs away…
The next days, he returns to the place accompanied by the police and will look around for traces of the banquet, with no success… Little by little, he will realize that a strange underground world exists, filled with worrying creatures…
“The Rat Savior” (or “The Redeemer”), an adaptation of the Russian novel by Alexander Grin, is a suspenseful movie where adventure meets fantasy. It is the 5th feature film by the Yugoslav director Krsto Papić, whose movie “Handcuffs” has been awarded the Silver Hugo at the Chicago International Film Festival."

A young man, his wife (still a child herself) and their child move in next to Wanda’s coffeehouse. They are mixing with the local people, just as picturesque as marginal, just as seducing as dangerous, by working at Wanda’s for her and by befriending thugs for him. Their bubble of happiness quickly makes room for dramas, but also sexual and criminal perturbations…
That is a conventional introduction for a movie with scenes as dense as indescribable: “at least be aware that we can see John Waters stars as Divine, a girly godfather (‘the role of my life’, according to him), Joe Morton as a nerdy thug, John Sayles as the ‘brother from another planet’ and Keith Carradine alternately wearing many makeup looks that are both Prince and Pigalle worthy! Just like in his delightful ‘Choose Me’, Alan Rudolph (whose movie ‘Endangered Species’ was almost awarded when presented during the festival of ’85) mixes up laughing and dreaming. But in this hybrid movie, in between polar and science fiction, the violence of the characters and the situations almost reach their climax, and even surrealism sometimes. Thanks to Rudolph, the actors have a rare density: Kristofferson starring as a withered and nervous cowboy, Carradine as a punk hippie gangster, Bujold being incredible as a lucid yet bitter Wanda, Lori Singer (‘Footloose’) turned into Ophélie from the suburbs” (Hélène Merrick).
The soundtrack is made of an original music by Mark Isham, with the husky voice of Marianne Faithfull."

The Post-ZOZOS are a group of young whimsical, humorous and disrespectful artists who were so much alike that they decided to come together and create exciting, colorful and really impertinent works.
These are great works that are made of everything we can think of, from the “vache-qui-rit” to the little green guys as well as the streetwalker, the corrida, the slot machine, the flying carpet, majorettes, the exhibitionist, the carousel, the fishing reel, the riot, the “baraque à frites”, Bambi, cosmonauts, etc. All of this is extraordinarily colorful, full of movement, incoherence and a devil-may-care attitude. The only reason why someone might not enjoy this work is if they are the saddest person alive. We want to get in there, to make a place for ourselves right next to King Kong and the scooter champion, and then ride with them to the “Roture” while singing “Valeureux Liégois”—because this work comes from the “Ardent City” and the heady waters of the Spa region.

I have always been intrigued by the decay—of people, animals and plants. I also think that the color palette of decay is deliciously decadent. The simple materials that I use—zinc, lead—work perfectly with that atmosphere. I do not understand why the majority of people do not see eye to eye with that. Why is it the opposite? Why does that fill them with horror? I enjoy the idea of death. I might be defying and defeating death by giving it this aesthetic dimension. But fuck it, I am the one in charge. 
If I also add one of these chicks with long legs, death is being kicked right in the nuts.
The thing is, it rarely ever leads anywhere. So, I am forced to do it over and over again.

Born in 1937 in St-Ghislain.
He studied at the Académie royale des Beaux-Arts in Mons.
He is a miner for the collieries in Tertre, in the region of Hainaut, Belgium, where he drew the first prevention drawings of the mine for his coworkers.

He was the artistic director of the Association Nationale pour la prévention des Accidents du Travail (National Association for the Prevention of Occupational Accidents) in Brussels between 1959 and 1984 (where he drew more than 800 safety posters).

Since 1961, he has showcased several personal and collective exhibitions in Belgium and abroad (paintings and posters).

When it comes to paintings as well as posters, everything is mostly based on mankind and its condition; his taste for the human anatomy is reflected in an expressionist and baroque way in his spatial creations.

Remarkable drawer, he likes to wound people’s consciences and eyes by using clashing colors. It was a deliberate choice made by that “muscle” artist.
It is true that here, bodies have an acquaintance with minerals and plants, but mostly – and much more – with a lust for life, or it is more likely, with the fear in their guts.
In the end, it is a strange painting coming from an incredible character, not so far from the new Italian and German expressionists, especially regarding the crudeness of the colors because, when it comes to graphic design, Calisto Peretti is predominantly a personal master with a diabolical touch. We must however admit that, in this case, the artist plays with the chromatic hell.
