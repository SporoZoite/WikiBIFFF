Deborah Kara Unger, Ian McNeige,
Chandra West",,,,,,,101',"Horror, Drama, Mystery",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0375210,",,,,,"Jonathan Rivers, a successful architect,
is married to Anna, a bestselling
author. Tragedy sets in when Anna goes
missing and is eventually found dead.
Jonathan’s world collapses. A while
later, he’s contacted by a man named
Raymond Price, who claims that he has
been receiving Anna’s messages from
the afterlife. Jonathan gets drawn into
the study of EVP and soon becomes obsessed
with recording voices and images
from beyond as he is desperate to
stay in contact with Anna. He also meets
fellow EVP user Sara Tate, who like Jonathan
becomes involved in a deeper and
darker mystery as he begins to decipher
a pattern behind the messages.
White Noise is based on the actual study
of EVP or Electronic Voice Phenomena, in
which the voices of dead people speak to
the living via static in electronic devices.
This is not your average Hollywood scary
movie. It's enjoyably slow-paced and
intense. First-time feature director Geoffrey
Sax (BBC’s Spitting Image, The New
Statesman, Widows) works well against
the clichés of the genre and delivers some
chilling images you haven't seen before.
Michael Keaton (Batman, Multiplicity,
Jackie Brown) carries the film with his performance
of the tortured Jonathan Rivers.
Deborah Unger (Crash, Fear X, One Po1nt 0)
plays Sara Tate and Ian McNeice (From Hell,
Freeze Frame) is Raymond Price."

Sin Lung Leung, Hsiao Liang",,,,,,,95',"Action, Comedy, Fantasy",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0373074,",,,,,"Sing, a hapless wannabe gangster,
must overcome his inability to wield
a knife and demonstrate his mettle in
order to become a member of the notorious
Axe Gang. The gang itself wants
to reign supreme by occupying Hong
Kong’s most coveted territory; Pig’s
Sty Alley, a sacred street protected by
an unlikely cast of characters, many of
whom are kung fu masters disguised as
ordinary people. When the locals start
to fight back, the gang resorts to hiring
more lethal martial arts mercenaries in
an escalating battle. Sing must choose
between the gang and the locals and
overcome his inadequacy in a series of
fearsome encounters.
With a delirious mix of the sublime
and the silly, director-actor Stephen
Chow (Shaolin Soccer) has taken the
kung fu comedy genre to new hilarious
heights. In Kung Fu Hustle, Chow combines
Matrix-style effects, Yuen Woping-
choreographed fights and his own
scatological slapstick for a wild and
accomplished piece of entertainment.
Not only is Kung Fu Hustle funny, it is
action packed, moves like a bullet train
and is beautifully shot and edited. There
is romance, slapstick, horror, action,
a Roadrunner-style chase and countless
people getting whacked on the head.
Kung Fu Hustle is destined to become a
Hong Kong irreverent classic."

student at the university.
Her work has won her the acclaim
of both her peers and her professors
but it leaves her cold and indifferent.
Then, one day, she witnesses a fatal
car crash and, torn between revulsion
and fascination, snaps a shot of a slain
pedestrian. This morbid shot awakens
emotion and excitement within her. She
becomes increasingly obsessed with
death, snapping shots of suicides and
hiring butchers to slaughter animals on
camera. When her fixation threatens to
overwhelm her, she finally pulls away
from the precipice. All seems well until
someone anonymously leaves photographs
and a video for her, photos and
film that appear to be an actual killing
staged and caught on camera specifically
for her.
The Pang brothers (Bangkok Dangerous,
The Eye, The Tesseract) are at it again
with Oxide at the helm and Danny in the
producers’ seat. Ab-Normal Beauty is
chock full of gorgeous and disturbing
cinematography and edited with punch
and style. The snuff movie theme is
combined with horror movie elements
to create a frightening tale of extreme

stories. His name has been passed
down from generation to generation in
the hushed, fearful whispers of kids at
bedtime. Existing in a thousand different
forms in children’s imaginations,
the Boogeyman is that horrible creature
who consumes human beings whole.
He lurks in the shadows of closets that
won’t stay closed. He haunts the deepest,
darkest recesses beneath squeaky
beds. Tim is 20. But for him the Boogeyman
still lives in his memories as the
creature that devoured his dad 16 years
earlier. Did this really happen or did he
make it up to explain why his father
abandoned the family ? The answer lies
hidden in his childhood home, a place
he must return to and face the chilling,
unanswered question : does the Boogeyman
really exist ?
Boogeyman, directed by Stephen T. Kay
(Tv’s The Shield, Get Carter), is the latest
treat from producers Sam Raimi and
his partner-in-crime Rob Tapert. With
fascinating characters, tons of bonechilling
scares and jump-out-off-yourseats
thrills, Boogeyman promises to
be an exiting new horror brand. Starring
young talents Barry Watson (Teaching
Mrs. Tingle) and Emily Deschanel (Cold

Fumiyo Kohinata, Hiroyuki Miyasako",,,,,,,142',"Science-Fiction, Action",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0405821,",,,,,"After a ravaging 50-year war, the
Greater Eastern Federation has
wrestled control of the Eurasian continent.
The survivors have rebuilt using
Machine Age technology, but the long
struggle has left them physically and
spiritually spent. Then a genetic scientist,
Dr. Azuma, develops a revolutionary
neo-cell treatment for the afflicted,
including his wife Midori, who has been
blinded by a pollution-caused disease.
Before he can deliver his miracles, however,
a mishap in the lab gives birth to
a new race of mutants, who escape and
build an underground movement. Their
leader is Brai, a super-mutant with a
mad vision for a peaceful world. When
Tetsuya, Azuma’s son, is killed on the
battlefield, his father uses the neo-cell
cure to revive him. Tetsuya is reborn
as the bionic hero Casshern, the only
one who can put an end to the carnage
wrought by Brai and his minions.
Casshern is undoubtedly one of the most
expected films of the festival and rightly
so. This retro-futuristic epic will leave
you stunned and exhausted in your
seats. The story has an operatic sweep
and grandiosity that makes recent large
scale Hollywood fare like Troy or Alexander
pale by comparison. Awesome
production design, cutting-edge CG
images, exciting live-action and stopmotion
animation all combine to make
Casshern one of the most impressive
viewing experiences ever."

Sang-mi Nam, Hye-bin Jeon, Lee Shin,
Yoon-ji Lee, Hee-ju Jeon",,,,,,,98',Horror,,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0410537,",,,,,"Ji-won is a bright young student with
a promising future ahead of her. Her
past is a different story. Something happened
to her a while ago and left her
with a blank memory. Ji-won has no recollection
of who she is, who her friends
were or what her life was before the incident.
When Eun-seo, one of Ji-won’s
old classmates, is found dead, drowned
in her home, she begins to investigate
her past. She’s desperate for any kind of
information, but nobody will talk to her.
Back in high school, Ji-won ran with a
clique of bullies. One girl in particular,
Su-in, was always at the wrong end of
their torments. Desperately wanting to
join the popular clique, Su-in did everything
to please them. A year ago, she
disappeared, never to be seen again.
Ghost goes for the jugular right in the
first scene with some very scary moments.
Once debut-director Tae-kyung
Kim has our attention, he makes Jiwon’s
frustrated search for the truth the
core of the film. But nothing will prepare
her, or us, for the earth-shattering revelation,
when the truth is exposed in
the final scene. This is yet another solid
Korean horror movie, with everything
we’ve come to expect : great cinematography,
a kick-ass soundtrack, with
an ingenious sound design that’ll make

corpse of a woman and, by its side, a
little girl in a state of shock. Young psychiatrist
Beatriz Varga starts to work
at a remote but prestigious sanatorium
that specialises in hypnosis. There she
learns about the case of the little girl. On
her first day, Beatriz manages to get an
answer out of her that has never been
heard before. Her hopes of helping the
girl are trashed when she’s found dead,
her veins slashed. The enigmatic patient
M. warns Beatriz that it wasn’t suicide.
Reality and fantasy begin to merge in
the increasingly unstable mind of the
doctor. Patients who foresee deaths,
clues that lead to different suspects,
prophetic visions, circular corridors that
hide deadly secrets and new deaths.
Will Beatriz be next ?
David Carreras joins the swelling ranks

Hellevator is the first feature film of exiting

a unique piece of abstract, psychologically

mercenaries, vampires, monks, school
kids and yakuzas. He attracts the attention
of the Lords of the Universe.
His trans-temporal killing spree annoys
them greatly. Izo, however, is not about
to bow to anyone, not even the Gods.
This year’s Takashi Miike is a bit different
from his other 60-something films.
It’s Miike’s first foray in samurai swashbuckling
and despite his trademark abundant
ultra-violence, this time he’s deadly
serious. Miike and scriptwriter Shigenori
Takechi (Deadly Outlaw Rekka, The Man in
White) have constructed the film as a relentless
statement about the insanity and
futility of violence, murder and war. Kazuya
Nakayama, who plays Izo, tirelessly charges
and slashes through scene after scene,
as if it’s an Olympic discipline. Another
master of contemporary Japanese cinema,
Takeshi Kitano (Hana-bi, Zatoichi) makes a
remarkable appearance as the tight-lipped,
hollow-eyed immortal Prime Minister."

Dau uses her magical skills to her advantage,

An inexperienced practitioner who ignores
the rules might become evil or
“bawb”, possessed by a spirit with a
taste for human innards. British director
Paul Spurrier (Underground) has made
a remarkable and scary film about this
phenomenon. It’s not only the first Thai

This compilation of clips from Japan’s weirdest late evening

shorts and music videos. Featuring the misadventures of a family
of window dressing puppets that just moved to Japan, a zombie
family (mother and two daughters) which struggles with everyday
problems, an extra terrestrial who hosts even weirder guests
on board of a spaceship which interior resembles your average

presented karaoke-style. From totally incomprehensible to

a fascinating viewing experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2005,event,Workshop,,"10th Workshop ""Brussels Fantastic""",,,,,"In March 1996, the Brussels International Festival of Fantastic Film organized for the first time the Workshop “Fantastic Brussels”. The ambition of this initiative has remained unchanged throughout the years: to offer the students of our film schools the opportunity to complete their experience in the various stages of film production: scriptwriting, shooting, editing, production and administration… All this under the supervision of an experienced foreign film director. As for the 9 previous editions we will, for this 10th jubilee edition, work together with the students of the RITS and the NARAFI. The supervision of this workshop has been entrusted to John Hough. This British filmmaker – whose rich filmography includes episodes of famous television series (The Prisoner, The Avengers), family fantasy movies (Disney’s Escape To Witch Mountain) or genuine cult classics (The Legend Of Hell House, Incubus) – will reveal some secrets of his craft to a new generation of directors. 
The public can even witness the main stages of the Workshop, as the films will be shot in the vicinities of the Festival. This year, the Botanique and the surrounding gardens have been chosen for scouting and the shooting. The 3 shorts will be shot from Tuesday 8th until Thursday 10th of March. After one week of editing and post-production, they will be presented during the Belgian Film Day, on Friday March 18th at 17:30 at the Botanique. Folowing this public screening, we will reward some of the students for their outstanding work on these projects. The author’s society SACD will offer a prize to the most personal scriptwriting or directing: the recipient will participate to one of the international film festivals (Cannes, Annecy, Rotterdam …) where the SACD organizes events. Eye-Lite will provide one student with a value of 2,500 € in lightning material for his/her next film project. The event will close with a reception where the students will meet some professionals of the film sector.
The workshop is made possible thanks to the help of our logistical sponsors : the Jean-Pierre Finotto Make-Up School ; Eye-Lite for sound and lightning material ; Cine & FX for SFX and postproduction facilities ; APPLE and Double Precision for digital editing cells. Thanks to the collaboration and the support of the Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie, Dienst Onderwijs & Dienst Cultuur, the Workshop of the BIFFF has become a precious and qualitative tool in the education of our future film makers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2005,event,Gaming,Nexus Awards,The Nexus part 5 - Award of the Best Fantasy Computer Game,,,,,"Compared to last year, the cards of the small game playing world are slightly different. While the situation of the console has been stabilized with the unimaginative delivery of long attended sequels (GTA San Andreas, Prince of Persia 2, Halo 2, Jak 3, etc), the huge releases on PC have shaken up things (World of Warcraft, Half Life 2 et Doom 3). Sequels too, you might add, but ones who gave the industry – in terms of technique and game play – the necessary oxygen. This said, no one doubts that in 2005 all the attention will once again go to the console, the portable console to be more precise, with the simultaneous release of two machines with exciting potential: the PSP by Sony and the DS by Nintendo.

the coming “re-release”, Eric Van Beuren
and the BIFFF present a special screening
of “Marquis”, a film by Henri Xhonneux.
”Marquis” written and directed by Roland
Topor, is a film that brakes boundaries.
The protagonist, is a Marquis with the
head of a dog, ( in which we can easily
recognize De Sade ) is an heroic individual
whose rebellion is spontaneous and
whose imagination has absolute freedom.
Marquis dialogues with Colin , his
sex. Colin is young full of vitality, but has
changeable health an character. He lives
in the moment, from day to day. His relation
with Marquis is that of gifted son and
his modern father.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2005,event,"Hommage, Hommage Jules Verne & Karem Zeman",,Hommage Jules Verne & Karem Zeman,"Jules, Verne",,,,"Tribute to Jules Verne
Immediately after his fi rst successes,
Karel Zeman (1910-
1989) was surnamed 'the
Czech Méliès'. Zeman was a
huge admirer of Méliès, and just
like the French fi lm pioneer, he
adored the work of Jules Verne.
Zeman's career starts in the
world of advertising where he
learns the tricks of the trade for
his later so renowned puppet
fi lms. Very quickly, Zeman creates
his own style by combining
different techniques (collage,
animation, trickery, puppet
show). The Deadly Invention,
in which he animated the
original engravings of Verne's
book, marks his breakthrough.
Zeman would repeat the same
technique with engravings of
Doré for Baron Münchhausen.
A unique opportunity to
(re)discover this magical universe.
Apart from the Karel Zeman
retrospective, the Film Museum
also screens two classic Verne
adaptations: Around the World
in 80 days (Michael Anderson,
1956) and 20.000 Leagues under
the Sea (Richard Fleischer,
1954). Some Méliès shorts will
accompany the retrospective.

2005,event,"Retrospective, Polish & Czech Fantastic Films",,Polish & Czech Fantastic Films,,,,,"This year, Cinema Nova sets the spotlights
on the East. The focus of the
retrospective is the fantastic film production
of two countries behind the former
Iron Curtain (Poland and Czechoslovakia),
nowadays three new members of the European
Union.
When we talk about Eastern European
cinema, we do not immediately say genre
movies. But fantastic film has always had
its own place, even if it was only because
of the Slavonian-Jiddish roots, where the
legends of the Dybbuk or the Golem are
part of the collective conscious. Neither
can we deny the great tradition of the
fantastic literature: the Sarragosa Manuscript
by Count Potocki, the work of Polish
writers such as Bruno Schultz and Stanislas
Lem (science fiction author of Solaris)
remain a reference. And let’s not forget
the surrealist movement, which was
renowned from Prague (Kafka) to Saint
Petersburg (Gogol). This is why many of
the Polish and Czech fantastic films were
adaptations of the above mentioned novels,
or at least inspired by them. The
theatre of the absurd and puppet animation
(take the films by Jan Svankmajer for
instance) have finally also been of major
influence.
Each time the totalitarian state censure
forbade direct criticism, the genre lent
itself as the perfect vehicle to criticize
the socio-economical system. Especially
science fiction, often inspired by H.G.
Wells, George Orwell, or Aldous Huxley’s
dystopic novels, was used to this means.
The best films, however, always managed
to surpass the political particularities of
the moment and dig into the deeper layers
of the unique Eastern European historical
and cultural perception. Typical is
the often used black humour, the lyrical
and dreamlike style and the subtle and
inventive approach of horror and the grotesque.
The retrospective offers a particular
selection: 17 treasures, divided over
15 screenings, an amalgam of provoking
science fiction, surrealist satire, absurd
allegory and dark fantasy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
