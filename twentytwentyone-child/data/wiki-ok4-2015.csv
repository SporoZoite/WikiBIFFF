Daddario, Oliver Cooper, Ozioma Akacha",,,,,,,89',"Comedy, Horror, Romance",,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3339674/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1,,,,,"What would the world be without American director Joe Dante, the man responsible for classics such as Piranha and Gremlins? His latest film, Burying the Ex, does him credit as the king of horror comedy, even though it starts on a sad note. Max, our hero, bitterly regrets having moved in with his girlfriend Evelyn. The pretty damsel turns out to be one mean and manipulative bitch. Luckily there’s a speeding bus that puts a rather abrupt ending to Evelyn’s life. No more worries for Max. He can now start a new live with his dream girl Olivia. But behold, isn’t that Evelyn crawling out of her grave and knocking on Max and Olivia’s door for a not very friendly social visit?!

Burying the Ex gives a new and bloody meaning to the term “relationship crisis”. It’s not only the result of decades of making movies, but also of an entire life devouring and loving movies. This subversive take on the zombie genre stuffed with very funny references and one-liners, could only have been made by Joe Dante. And the cast is also top-notch:  Anton Yelshin (Star Trek), Ashley Greene (Twilight) and Alexandra Daddario (Texas Chainsaw 3D)."
2015,movie ,"Opening, International Thriller Competition",,TAKING OF TIGER MOUNTAIN - 3D,Tsui Hark                                                                ,2014,"China , Hong Kong",European,International Thriller Competition,"Kenny Lin, Mo Tse,Tony 
Leung Ka-fai, Liya Tong, Hanyu Zhang, Geng Han",,,,,,,141',"Action, Adventure",,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3950078/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1,,,,,"The Taking of Tiger Mountain is inspired by a story from the Chinese revolution. At the center is the confrontation between a squad of soldiers from the Peoples Liberation Army and a brutal gang of bandits that are terrorizing a mountainous region in China. Captain’s Shao squad is sent to stop the bandits. But after a long trek through the snowy mountains, they realize they are far outnumbered and outgunned by their adversaries. Their headquarters are in a fort on Tiger Mountain. It’s David against Goliath, with certain death awaiting Shao and his men. But there’s no way back. They’ll have to take Tiger Mountain! 

Tsui Hark has already realized some 50 long features, but that doesn’t stop the grandmaster from Hong Kong to keep shooting one big budget production after another. The Taking of Tiger Mountain is an epic action extravaganza with everything you can expect from the genre: spectacular combat scenes in majestic landscapes, gravity defying stunt work, eye-popping special effects and a solid cast with Tony Ka Fai Leung (Detective Dee, Election), Cung Le (The Grandmaster) and Nan Yu (The Expendables 2) playing the leads."
2015,movie ,Closing,,BIG GAME,Jalmari Helander,2014,"Fineland , UK , Germany , USA",European,,"Samuel L. Jackson, Onni Tommila, Ray Stevenson,

He has to prove himself as a hunter. Only armed with bow and arrow, he must go deep into the Finnish woods and come back in 24 hours with the biggest possible trophy. No pressure, as his father and grandfather have made legendary kills and Oskari’s prowess with the bow leaves much to be desired. But luck is on his side, because the biggest prey of all time is parachuted at his feet. It’s the president of the United States, who narrowly escaped death after terrorists shot down Airforce One. And they’re coming after him. It’s up to Oskari to save the day… and the world!

Director Jalmari Helander already scored big at the BIFFF when his feature debut, Rare Exports, won the Audience Award in 2011. His second long feature is a huge crowd pleaser. The American president is none other than Samuel L. Jackson. And young Finnish supertalent Onni Tommila (who was also the lead in Rare Exports) easily rivals him in charisma and acting talent. The supporting cast are outstanding, with Ray Stevenson (Divergent), Felicity Hufman (Desperate Housewives) and Jim Broadbent (Iris) leading the pack. Big Game is one huge entertaining and thrilling ride that gives a firm and loving salute to the action movies of the eighties. "

Scandinavian cinema is known for its black and undercooled humor. In Order of Disappearance is a true gem in this genre. The film is director Hans Petter Moland’s fourth collaboration with Stellan Skarsgård, whom we know from Lars von Trier’s films, but also from big blockbusters such as Thor and The Avengers. Its cold atmosphere reminds you of Fargo, while the bodies pile up in a Tarantino-esque way. This Norwegian Kill List won, among others, the Best International Film Award at Fantasia Montréal."
2015,movie ,International Competition,,THE BLUE ELEPHANT,Marwan Hamed,2014,Egypt,European,International Competition,"Karim Abdel Aziz, Khaled Al Sawy, Nelly Karim,

He drowns his grief in whisky and doesn’t bother to turn up at work. His boss wants to shake him out of his stupor and puts him to the choice: either stop completely or start working in prison with mentally disturbed heavy criminals. Yehia goes for the job and runs into a familiar face. Sherif was one of his best friends from high school and is suspected of having violently raped and murdered his wife. It is said he’s faking his illness to avoid the firing squad. But Yehia thinks it’s anything but normal that Sherif only speaks in riddles and mathematical formulas. He starts to dig deeper into the case. 

It’s not every day that you get to see an Egyptian thriller with fantastic undertones. The Blue Elephant is a rock solid cinematic ride that, in very intelligent ways, breaks lots of taboos in the Arab word. Add to that the sumptuous imagery of director Marwan Hamed and the intense performance of the ravishing Nelly Karim, and you get a highly recommended viewing experience."
2015,movie ,International Competition,,THE DEAD LANDS,Toa	Fraser,2014,New Zealand,Belgian,International Competition,"Pana Hema Taylor, Lawrence Makoare, James
Rolleston",,,,,,,108',"Action, Adventure",,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3399916/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1,,,,,"After his tribe is slaughtered through an act of treachery, Hongi, a Maori chieftain's teenage son, must avenge his father's murder in order to bring peace and honor to the souls of his loved ones. Vastly outnumbered by a band of villains, Hongi's only hope is to pass through the feared and forbidden Dead Lands and forge an uneasy alliance with the mysterious “Warrior”, a ruthless fighter who has ruled the area for years.

The Dead Lands gives a truly unique and (lucky for us) deliciously violent look on Maori culture long before Captain Cook started to put his meddlesome big nose in the affairs of the fiercely tattooed warriors from what was to become New Zealand. It’s the first film to highlight Mau Rakau, the traditional Maori martial art fighting style. Our young protagonist will learn the hard way how violence, vengeance, leadership and social standing are intertwined in this unique, epic and visually impressive film. "
2015,movie ,"International Competition, The Night, 33rd Fantastic Night",,EVERLY,Joe Lynch,2014,USA,Belgian,International Competition,"Salma Hayek, Jennifer Blanc, Togo
Igawa, Hiroyuki Watanabe",,,,,,,92',"Action, Thriller",,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1945084/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1,,,,,"Everly has been violently gang-raped in her apartment by thugs sent by her ex-boyfriend, a mob boss. She wants nothing more than to die and leave all this pain and suffering behind. She is beaten, but not broken. Her mother and daughter are still alive and need to be moved out of there. Before she goes out with a bang, she’ll try to kill each and every one in her path until she secures the safety of her loved ones. Only then will her attackers be able to steal her last breath.

At the other side of the Atlantic, a few irreverent critics called Everly “Die Hard with tits”. While that’s not far off the mark, it would be wrong to reduce this badass closed quarters extravaganza to this. Director Joe Lynch (Chillerama, Knights of Badassdom) is a true connoisseur of exploitation cinema and generously robs the genre blind to deliver this outrageous action gem that will delight fans of bloody mayhem, gore and black humor; with everything tied together by the magnificent Salma Hayek (From Dusk Till Dawn, Frida)."
2015,movie ,International Competition,,FRANKENSTEIN,Bernard	Rose,2015,USA,World,International Competition,"Xavier Samuel, Carie-Anne Moss, Danny Huston, 
Tony Todd",,,,,,,99',"Horror, Science-Fiction, Thriller",,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4086032/?ref_=nm_knf_t3,,,,,"This latest adaptation of Mary Shelley’s immortal classic is set in present day Los Angeles and is told entirely from the perspective of the Monster, who’s called Adam. After he is artificially created with a revolutionary 3D printer by Elizabeth and Victor Frankenstein, a husband-and-wife team of eccentric scientists, Adam is left for dead by his creators. He is confronted with nothing but aggression and violence from the world around him. This perfect creation-turned disfigured monster must come to grips with the horrific nature of humanity.
 
Bernard Rose, the director of Paperhouse (Golden Raven Bifff 1990) and Candyman (Bifff 1993) returns to Brussels with a truly original version of the famous horror tale that is an existential roller coaster that is both emotional and terrifying. While older versions of Frankenstein have focused on reanimating the dead, this movie explores creating life from nothing, just as Mary Shelley originally imagined. Bernard Rose’s Frankenstein can count on a terrific cast, led by Xavier Samuel (Adore, Twilight Saga: Eclipse, Fury) as Adam and with Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix Trilogy) and Danny Huston (American Horror Story: Coven, Big Eyes) as Elizabeth and Victor Frankenstein, and Tony Todd (Candyman) as their assistant Eddie. Special effects are courtesy of Randy Westgate (X-Men Origins: Wolverine). "
2015,movie ,International Competition,,GOODNIGHT MOMMY,"Severin Fiala,  Veronika  Franz",2014,Austria,Belgian,International Competition,"Susanne Wuest, Elias Schwarz, Lukas Schwarz",,,,,,,99',"Thriller, Horror, Mystery",,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3086442/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1,,,,,"A mother returns from hospital with her head covered in bandages. She demands total silence from her two sons, who are identical twins. No sunlight is allowed into the house. Only one of the brothers may eat. The other one gets nothing. They’re not allowed to have contact with each other. Their house becomes a prison, a hospital, a breeding ground for madness and trauma. 

There must be something strange in the Austrian air. They regularly produce chillingly frightening art-house movies that take you on a demonic sightseeing trip through the vile sewers of the human soul. Everybody knows Michael Haneke’s vicious dissections of humanity. But there’s also Michaël by Markus Shleinzer, who exposed us to the inner world of a pedophile. And the movies of Ulrich Seidl (Dog Days, Import/Export, the Paradise trilogy) always take you to places you’ve never wanted to go to. All these movies show a kind of horror that can’t be laughed away, that profoundly disturbs and confronts because it is rooted in grim reality. Goodnight Mommy, by Severin Fiala en Veronika Franz (who happens to be the co-writer of Ulrich Seidl’s films) is a brilliant addition to these “horrors of the human psyche” tradition."
2015,movie ,International Competition,,THE GREAT HYPNOTIST,Leste	Chen,2014,China,Belgian,International Competition,"Jing Hu, Zhong Lu, Karen Mok, Yaoqing Wang, 
Zheng Xu",,,,,,,104',"Thriller, Drama, Mystery",,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3720058/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1,,,,,"‘I See Dead People’ Asian style, could be the tagline for his slick and stylish ghost flick. Doctor Xu, a renowned psychoanalyst and a big fan of hypnotherapy, meets his biggest professional challenge yet. His new patient is the stunningly beautiful, but incurably ill Ren, a woman who has spent more time on a therapist’s couch than in her own bed. His hypnotherapy sessions turn into otherworldly experiences, where seeing the death becomes as usual as breathing. Things take a bizarre turn when the doctor finds out he also has ghosts hovering around him. 

Leste Chen is known for the box office hit Say Yes, a fine and delicate comedy. But his latest feature marks a return to his first love: directing blood curdling horror films like The Heirloom (2005). The Great Hypnotist is an intriguing ghostly whodunit, benefiting from a strong script and fine performances by leading lady Karen Mok (Shaolin Soccer, Man of Tai Chi) as Ren and Zheng Xu (No Man’s Land, Lost in Thailand) as Doctor Xu."

During one of her spying sessions, she becomes fascinated by an old and very grumpy porn addict. Unfortunately for Nami, he doesn’t stay lonesome and unbearable for long. The man finds solace and joy in a religious community. Once again he walks around happily, reconnects with his family and makes new friends. But Nami is not about to let that go on for long.

The best description for Greatful Dead would be a new version of Takashi Miike’s The Audition. It starts as a bizarre Japanese comedy, but then becomes ever more dark and obscene. If you like your humor weird, love to discuss social problems and like to see cute girls completely loose it, then Greatful Dead might be something for you. Brace yourself for a horrific dramedy that will make you squirm in your seat, starring Itsuji Itao (Tokyo Gore Police) and Hôka Kinoshita (Ichi The Killer). "

And that’s only logical, because Charlie is a gravekeeper. But his boss wants to lengthen his suffering with another six month by sending him to another necropolis whose gravedigger in chief died in mysterious circumstances. If Charlie wants to receive full retirement benefits, he has no other choice than to accept his last assignment. When he moves into his new city of the dead, Charlie discovers that it’s not just his predecessor that passed away. Every guardian of this place went completely psychotic after a while and became more than eager to join the legion of the dead. You see, this is not an ordinary cemetery. This is nothing less than the Hellmouth, the gates to the underworld, and it has special plans for Charlie.

Hellmouth is a stunning, spectacular ode to classic horror and fantasy, with its unique neo-retro look blending Sin City with German expressionism. And it comes from none other than director John Geddes (Exit Humanity) and the scriptwriter and lead actor of Pontypool (Bifff 2010): Tony Burgess and Stephen Mc Hattie. "

Thirty years later she gets released and immediately starts to investigate what really happened. Belief, fate and the notion of time get mixed up in a mysterious, intangible puzzle. You’ll be at the edge of our seats, watching each plot change with awe and fascination. 

Halleluja! A new master of horror suspense has risen and he hails from Venezuela. Alejandro Hiodalgo’s The House At The End Of Time was a big hit in his native country and you’ll soon find out why. What’s in store for us is almost a transcendental experience. Hidalgo, inspired by the classic haunted house movies, shows a Lovecraftian virtuosity for psychedelic suspense. And by playing with time, he adds an extra exciting dimension. It won’t be long before Hollywood snatches up the remake rights!"

Being a control freak, he manically recreates the same date as the year before. The same hotel, the same clothes, the same hour… At 13.54 they drink a glass of Champaign. At 14.02 their lips touch for the first time and at 14.08 it’s time for making whoopee. Everything should run perfectly to plan, but it’s exactly the opposite that takes place. The hotel looks more like a set from Mad Max 4 than a romantic dating spot. Lana is less than pleased with the proceedings and when her cocksure athletic previous beau shows up with a package of condoms and the conviction to use them all, he even gets away with it… and with Dean’s girl. There’s only one thing he can do: build a time travel machine to save his relationship. But messing with time is never without risk. Dean opens doors out of which several versions of himself pop up. Sometimes they’re alone, sometimes there are more of them, they try to steal Lana from Dean nr.1 or go for something completely else. We can only hope that something beautiful will grow out of this temporal chaos.
 
Aussie director Hugh Sullivan has taken a bold and ambitious risk with his feature film debut. Time travel movies are legion and they are often too frail or too complex (remember Primer!). Luckily for us, Sullivan has created a strong new addition to the genre. Dean’s temporal tomfoolery can even be compared to the ordeals of Bill Murray in Groundhog Day or Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind."

Fruit Chan has already collaborated with some big names in horror and thriller. In 2005 we screened Three, Extremes, directed by Takashi Miike, Chan-wook Park… and Fruit Chan. The Midnight After is based on a popular manga and masterfully plays both horror and comedy nerves. We’re already labelling this movie as cult. Wanna bet you’ll agree with us after the screening?"

Cohen’s main suspect is the children’s teacher, who tells him that the kids have actually been murdered

Ivan Noel is a self-taught director known for his guerilla style movies that he always put on the internet for everyone to see. He soon got noticed by the festival circuit because of his consistent body of work that often deals with moral dilemmas and the psychology of children. His dramaturgy is as macabre as it is poetic. The Returned is like a Latin-American version of Les Revenants with a poignant social-political undercurrent. "

Just like in Before Sunset, Before Sunrise and Before Midnight, Spring treats us to catchy dialogues about relationships, life, love and dead. Our two star crossed protagonists are the American Evan who, after the death of his mother, is bagpacking his way through Italy, and Louise, a ravishing art restorer whom he runs into in a picturesque town on the seaside. The surroundings are gorgeous and there’s heat and passion in the air. There’s only one thing that might stop their romance from blossoming. Whenever the moon is full in the sky, Louise falls prey to some strange transformations.

Fans of Jacques Tourneur’s Cat People or Paul Shraders remake are in for a treat. The latest movie from Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead (Resolution, V/H/S Viral) is a unique genre hybrid in which all fantastic and horrific elements are at the service of the dramatic development of the protagonists. Their boldness got rewarded with numerous festival selections, raving reviews and awards. Spring will sweep you away and will leave you gasping for air, especially when you first lay eyes on the delicious Nadia Hilker as Louise. "

Sarah is a naive aspiring actress who hopes to make it big in Tinseltown without any horizontal casting sessions with producers. After one failed audition too many, something breaks in Sarah. And her meltdown provides the key to success. Actors with a screw loose go far in Hollywood, but Sarah takes another path to onscreen glory, one that is littered with corpses.

This remarkable project got off the ground thanks to the Kickstarter platform; an online site where you can invest in games, music and movies. A clever promo campaign and a tight pitch provided Starry Eyes with the necessary funding and the end result is creating quite a stir on the festival circuit. Most of us are not prepared to go all the way to make it, but Sarah does. And it’ll make you shiver and shake."

Hannah and her son have managed to escape from the bombs, tanks and guns and have arrived at a place where everybody wants to go to: the No Man’s Land. Every refugee tries to get in, because it’s supposed to be a safe place from war and violence. Hannah and her son will soon discover that this place has more in common with Auschwitz than with Disney Land. Only the sun gets up for free, could have been the motto of the creators of No Man’s Land. In order to survive, you have to convince as many TV-viewers as possible. The “participants” are nothing more than easy entertainment for the viewing masses. And the more shocking the struggle to survive, the better. Even the Roman bread & circuses pales next to the No Man’s Land.

This first long feature of André Cruz Shiraiwa uses a lot of themes relevant to contemporary society: perverted viewing habits, voyeurism, apathy, the price of fame… Through the camera objective of reality-TV, we follow a mother who has to risk everything to keep her child alive. The result is a confronting mirror-image of ourselves, asking how we would react to these unhuman practices. "

Robots must strictly adhere to these protocols. Jacq discovers that some of them are repairing themselves and leave their posts to go off in the desert. Jacq wants to find out what is causing them to become self-aware, but there’s one man with a grudge against robots who will do everything it takes to destroy them. Their actions will have profound consequences for the future of humanity.

With Automata, Spanish director Gabe Ibanez has created a very unique vision of the future. The set up and the story might be familiar, reminding you of Blade Runner, I Robot or even David Fincher’s Seven, but Ibanez combines all these ideas and blends them into a powerful and moving scifi film with stunning visuals and great performances from Antonio Banderas as Jacq Vaucan (whose name is a homage to the 18century French inventor Jacques Vaucanson, creator of automatons), his ex-wife Melanie Griffith and Dylan McDermott as the bad guy."

They are captured by a band of outlaws, but after a while they discover a bigger threat that might kill them all: a mythical beasts that only comes out when that pretty moon is red. It’s going to be a long night, with any hope of seeing daylight fading fast.
Fans of the TV series Misfits are warned. Shaun Dooley is even more frightening on the big screen than as a probation worker. This horror-western was directed by none other than Jeremy Wooding, known for Magnificent Eleven and the hit series Peep show. He situates the story at the end of the Wild West and infuses it with supernatural powers. Just to be clear; this is not Cowboys & Aliens, but a balanced mix between the best genre elements: The Good, the Bad and the Terrifying!"

From that moment on, David feels a strange presence in the house. On top of that Alice disappears and the police are pointing to David as the main suspect.

It was the intention of director Ivan Kavanagh to make a visceral and sensuous movie. He has pulled this off with shining colors. This Irish genre gem reminds you of Argento’s Suspiria and, in its tendency for surrealism, of Un Chien Andalou and Lost Highway. We admit that we love to be generous with lofty references, but in this case they’re right on the spot. "

The Host meets An Inconvenient Truth.  Scandinavia also seems to have a knack at turning out teen oriented genre flicks. Remember Tomas Alfredson’s brilliant Let The Right One In (Golden Raven BIFFF 2009), partly a coming of age drama, partly a vampire movie. Danny’s Doomsday hails from Denmark and is a solid addition to this ever more popular subgenre."

His never present progenitor doesn’t exactly welcome him with open arms in his dank and humid apartment. While dad is busy stealing the neighborhood blind, Tommy tries to do some homework. So far this sounds like your typical 90ties social drama fare, but, lucky for us, Tommy hears some strange noises from the adjacent apartment. Dad tries to reassure him that he’s all alone in the flat and that there’s no reason to be scared. His advice doesn’t really help, especially when Tommy discovers that all his stuff has changed place. 

Oliver Frampton’s first long feature might be a full blooded horror flick, that doesn’t mean that he denounces his roots. Coming from the small screen, he transports his favorite theme of decrepit council flat life from the TV-series The Bill and turns it into creepy social horror."

She lures him to an exclusive private society where its members indulge in their passions by transgressing the borders of life and pain. 

The duo Michael Kosakowski and Andreas Marschall (Tears of Kali, Masks) and Jörg Buttgereit (Nekromantik) pride themselves on being Germany’s most controversial and disturbing directors. And that’s no understatement. German Angst is definitely not for sensitive souls or weak stomachs. Each of the three films is a madly insane, delirious and sadistic exploration of the dark underbelly of Berlin.

But that’s just the start. When Montse is under the influence of morphine, she gets visits by their deceased father.

The first film of David Rühm (The Escape, El Chico) in 17 years is a wickedly entertaining comedy with a lot of bite. There’s a surprisingly high amount of old fashioned gore and the cast have a lot of fun with their parts. Veteran actor Tobias Moretti (The Dark Valley, TV’s Commissioner Rex) plays the grumpy count Geza. Jeanette Hain (The Reader, The Whistleblower) is countess Elsa and Karl Fischer (Dead in 3 Days) incarnates Sigmund Freud."

In Fantasticherie Di Un Passeggiatore, Paolo Gaudio’s first long feature, we follow three characters that are influenced by Rousseau’s words: a poet obsessed by the reveries, a young student and a child in the woods. Each of these characters gives their interpretation of the unfinished masterpiece. Every segment is also recognizable by its own style, partially animation, partially live action. Paolo Gaudio is a true enfant terrible of Italian animation movies. With his passion for comics and his knowledge of philosophy, he creates a unique style, combining the visual richness and accessibility of animation movies with the depth of literature and philosophy.

To save her sister, Ayia turns to the local priest, who is anything but orthodox. He initiates Mirra in shamanistic rituals and convinces her to penetrate Mirra’s subconscious to expel the demons that torture her. 
If you’re thinking you’re going to see a Russian version of Under The Dome, you’re completely wrong. III is more closely related to movies such as The Cell and Vanishing Waves, where the exploration of the dark corners of the subconscious and the battle between good and evil are central.

Then both groups hear the same explosion and a body turns up. 

Ingmar Bergman once said about his legendary cult classic The Seventh Seal: ‘I wrote this film to conjure up my own fear of dying’. We think than Mexican director Isaac Ezban has also made The Incident to stave off his fear from death. Philip K.

During her absence, the ghost of Toni Tani, a Japanese pop idol from the seventies and Liza’s imaginary friend, murders poor Martha. And she’s just the first of a long line of victims.

Blend a bit of black comedy Takeshi Kitano style, the wardrobe of The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and a Japanese-Finnish soundtrack and you’ll get something like this deliciously daft Hungarian film. Liza, the Fox-Fairy gets its inspiration from one of the tales of Miyamoto Musashi, Japan’s most legendary samurai/philosopher, but is really a delightful potpourri of all possible genre elements."

Public services have all but disappeared and technology keeps evolving at breakneck pace. The streets of Buenos Aires are filled with the sounds of sirens from police cars and ambulances. The first are there to smother any kind of protest, while the latter gather up missing body parts. A private detective named Chocler gets a mission from the ravishingly beautiful and mysterious Lucrèce to find a certain Victor. It soon turns out that Victor has put its head in a hornet’s nest. He discovers a strange connection between horse races, genetic experiments and supernatural phenomena that take place at night. 

Director Galel Maidana was born in Honduras, but moved to Argentina when he was five years old, just at the time when the country left the military dictatorship behind. You can feel that he’s politically engaged, as his first long feature combines the look of Blade Runner with social and political nightmares."

One on One is based on a true story. A girl from primary school is brutally murdered in an alley. Enter a strange gang that calls itself the ‘Shadow group’, who go after the seven murder suspects. They shy away from nothing to make the men confess and Kim portrays their violent actions in the smallest detail. Juicy detail: Kim promised a handsome sum of money in The Korean Times to the one who could tell which, by the media completely ignored, news event had inspired One on One. 

It’s hard to believe, but this is already Kim Ki-duk’s 20th film. It’s a very committed and hard hitting movie. It’s no coincidence that the phonetic meaning of the name of his main character Min-ju means “democracy”. One on One is Kim’s own version of Stanley Milgram’s notorious experiment. In the end, we’re all like sheep in a flock."

Buddy Holly’s music keeps touching hearts. Swiss director Mathieu Seiler, whose The Outing was presented last year in our 7th Orbit Section, must have had Holly’s song in mind when he realized this meditation on love and death. But we’re certain Holly didn’t have such nightmarish images in mind when he wrote the song. True Love Ways is a haunting erotic thrill-ride shot in timeless black and white images."

In the director’s chair, we find Guillermo Arriaga himself (who, after a falling out with Iñarritu, started to direct himself, with films such as The Burning Plain), Hector Babanco (whom you know from the classic Kiss of the Spider Woman), Alex de la Iglesia (no introduction necessary at the BIFFF), Bahmin Ghobadi (from the Iranian new wave hits A Time for Drunken Horses and Turtles can Fly), Amos Gitai (Kippur, Free Zone), Emir Kusturica (two time Cannes Palme d’Or winner), Mira Nair (the Indian director of Salaam Bombay and Monsoon Wedding), Hideo Nakata (the godfather of J-Horror) and Warwick Thornton (who won the Cannes Caméra d’Or for Samson & Delilah).

Go is an extremely popular strategic game in Asia, with world championships and televised matches drawing crowds of millions. It has an especially huge following in Korea. So it’s no wonder that it proved fertile ground for a hard hitting thriller dealing with gambling, murder, revenge, martial arts and Go itself. Director Beom-gu Cho has turned the game into a life and dead struggle of brawn and brains, starring Woo-sung Jung (The Good, The Bad, The Weird, Reign of Assassins) as Ta-seok. "

His heart might be in the right place, but the way he acts is certainly unusual: beating up the entire soccer team for having bullied Caleb’s younger brother, dealing drugs at a party of younger sister Anna… What else does this unusual guest has in store for his new family?

Those who have seen You’re Next, know that director Adam Wingard and scriptwriter Simon Barett can churn out a genre pic that will keep you glued to the screen. They also don’t hide being fanatical movie nerds, stuffing The Guest with references to Terminator, Halloween and many other cult flics from the 80ties. And we’re also very happy with the cast. Dan Stevens is miles removed from his Downtown Abbey character; with by his side feisty Maika Monroe, whom we discovered in The Bling Ring."

The long feature debut of Sung-bo Shim, scriptwriter of Joon-ho Bong’s Memories of Murder, is one hell of a thriller based on real events. Shim asked himself what the most important thing would be for a man whose future has been confiscated. “In each of the characters in Haemoo, good and evil coexist and manifest themselves differently in different situations. I wanted to study how human beings react and reveal their true nature in unpredictable circumstances.” Joon-ho Bong (The Host, Snowpiercer) lent his scriptwriter a hand by producing the film, with Yoon-seok-Kim (The Chasr, The Yellow Sea) playing the lead as Captain Kang.

Honeymoon, the latest film from Mexican director Diego Cohen, was awarded with the Bloody Work in Progress Award at the recent Blood Window Festival in Argentina. This terrific mix of black comedy and torture porn might not be the ideal date with your future ex, but it’ll show her that forgetting to put out the trash is not the worst that could happen."

Also new in town is Lana, a Slovenian police officer, who has crossed the border, claiming to be following up a report of a bear attack, but actually investigating a darker and more sinister case.

The Ice Forest doesn’t only make you think of Fargo and Top of the Lake, its social and political themes with its references to the Yugoslavian civil war, remind you of Emir Kusturica’s films. And that’s no coincidence. Kusturica himself plays the part of Secondo, one of the key characters in this gripping thriller that will chill you to the bone, and not because of the icy mountain air!"

They are contacted by both Mafia clans claiming they have the kid and wanting to get their hands on the information. And both say they will kill him if Falcon doesn’t give them the stick. 

The Ignorance of Blood is the adaptation of the final novel of Robert Wilson’s popular Javier Falcon series by award winning director Manuel Gomez Pereira (Love Can Seriously Damage Your Health, Between Your Legs). The movie was shot in Sevilla, the Canary Islands, Morocco and Madrid, starring Juan Diego Botto (Zorro, El Greco) as Inspector Falcon and Paz Vega (Talk To Her, Sex and Lucia) as Consuelo.

La Isla Mínima was last year’s big winner at the Goya’s (The Spanish Oscars), receiving no less than 10 Prizes. Director Alberto Rodriguez (Unit 7) shot the film on location in the marshlands of Guadalquivir. Its atmosphere can only be compared to that of True Detective and the darkest David Fincher movies.

But Mini gets caught and sentenced to a lifetime of hard labour. Miranda, who feels guilty, tries to help him escape. But will they succeed? 

Mini and the mosquitos is the second big screen adaptation of the adventures of Mini. The film is directed by Danish animation stalwart Jannik Hastrup, a man with an impressive résumé whose unique style makes him an outsider within the classical animation scène. "

The large landowners may claim that they have their best interests at heart, behind the scenes they’ve got some shady individuals to “negotiate” with the last independent farmers. They use tried and tested methods such as harassment, rape, arson, murder… But there’s one man who doesn’t allow himself to be intimidated. His name is Vania and he’s a tobacco farmer. The thugs don’t know what they’re in for, because the jungle is Vania’s playground where he determines the rules.

This modern western with eye-catching landscapes that could come straight out of a Terrence Malick movie, tells a shocking tale that’s unfortunately daily reality for many small farmers in the rainforest. El Ardor premiered at the 2014 Cannes film festival and benefits from a great cast, led by Gael Garcia Bernal (Amores Perros, Babel) and Alice Braga (I Am Legend, Elysium) who take up the age-old fight of David against Goliath."

Almost all the employees of a spicy sauce factory are slaughtered. Responsible for this drama: hitman Victor Patibulo, notorious for sucking on a pacifier ever since his favorite poodle got killed. One body is absent among the dead: big boss Heraclito, who had just created a revolutionary new sauce. Is there a connection? There’s only one man who’ll be able to find out: the handsome, strong and clever Marcello Risk, star of the anti-terrorism unit K.K.D.B.B. Together with his sidekick, Guadalajara Man, big fan of martial arts and bananas, he’ll try to solve the mystery. But there are many weird and wonderful enemies on their path, their boss is mind-bogglingly dumb and their residential science genius hasn’t eaten in weeks. Cutbacks, you know!

Born to Die does not only sound insane, it actually is quite insane! This unofficial sequel to Bailando con el Peligro (Dancing with Danger) doesn’t take itself serious for one second. People who love absurd humor such as Shaolin Soccer or Kung Fu Hustle, will gobble this down. Director Andres Borghi has directed a riotously inventive piece of entertainment that will certainly make the audience howl and scream."

It’s then that the character of Mr. Babadook becomes ever more real. He starts to manifest himself in the house and even strikes a deal with the monsters under the bed. Amelia has to destroy the book before it destroys them.

The Babadook already gathered 33 awards worldwide. William Friedkin himself called it “one of the most frightening films ever.” No wonder that director Jennifer Kent’s debut feature was met with unanimous public and critical acclaim. "

It’s not long into the group’s trip when we’re introduced to Charlie. And he’s hell bent on continuing the family tradition and killing the intruders in the most violent ways imaginable.

This slasher from down under is a riotous piece of hack and slash fun that would make good ol’ Wes Craven proud. The plot might have been used countless times (thou shalt not wander into the woods to explore remote cabins with murderous maniacs running around), Charlie’s Farm is made with so much guts and energy and contains plenty of hilarious dialogues and volcanic blood eruptions, that you can only observe the carnage with a satisfied grin on your face."

Then one day he stumbles upon a magical heirloom that literally allows him to step into someone else’s shoes, take on their appearance and see the world through their eyes.

Tom McCarthy, director of The Station Agent and the Visitor, delights us with this incredibly ambitious and uniquely crazy mix between a mystical fairy tale and a brutal superhero movie in the vein of Kick Ass and Darkman.

Ten years after the fight, the boss of the Munakata-gumi gang goes to pick up his loyal lieutenant from prison. The guy took a bullet for him, so the boss kept an eye on his wife and daughter while he was doing time. But daughter dearest had to choose the day of her dad’s release to skip classes and have fun with her best friend on Zeni island. Very bad timing indeed, because the island falls prey to a zombie epidemic. Her dad has to come to the rescue. But the undead are not their only worry. The gang’s bitter rivals, who still have a score to settle with the Munakata-gumi, are also on the island.

One of the reasons for Director Hiroshi Shinagawa to realize Deadman Inferno was to celebrate the 30 years of Japanese actor Sho Aikawa on screen. Among his +/- 100 movies are titles such as Gozu, Dead or Alive and Zebraman, all directed by Takashi Miike. If you’ve ever wondered how yakuzas would battle zombies, look no further. But we can tell you that there’s no better weapon to chop up the undead than the katana. Fans of The Walking Dead know what we’re talking about!"

The Canadian The Editor not only gives us a fascinating insight on the set of a typical giallo – almost like the making of an imaginary movie – it’s also a loving homage to this terrific and typically Italian genre.

Let’s recapitulate. Giallo’s are mysterious murder tales in which the suspense of a Hitchcock movie is combined with gruesome body horror. Gialli are known for their flamboyant and experimental scripts, strange visuals, strongly elaborated production design, bold use of colors and lots of attention to music and atmosphere. The holy trinity of giallo directors consists of Dario Argento, Mario Bava and Lucio Fulci. The term giallo, Italian for yellow, refers to the color of the cover of the novels that inspired the gialli. Recently the genre has gathered some new international attention with Belgian directors Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani’s Amer and The Strange Color of Your Body’s Tears. The Editor, in its own fantastic, absurd and overwhelming way, contributes to the revival of this playful and unique genre."

Fara Sene is a former basketball player who has made a name for himself as a director of video clips and short features. After meeting the Belgian producer Nicolas George, he was able to turn his poignant vision on humanity into a long feature film.

After a few very bloody abductions, our heroes realize that the aliens will not stop before they are all anally probed to death. The cat and mouse game can start and there can be only one survivor. 
If you wanted to describe the atmosphere of Extraterrestrial, you could say it’s a combination of the themes from Signs and Steven Spielberg’s War Of the Worlds, mixed with the tension of a David-Fincher-on-acid. This sci-fi slasher gives a crash-course of what people are going through when they’re picked up by those “friendly” lights in the sky. Extraterrestrial is the latest directorial effort from the Vicious Brothers. They made their mark with Grave Encounters, a true antidote to any Paranormal Activity related franchises. Just to say that these guys know something about rhythm, tension and the art of found footage."

Internal Affairs is going to pass by to turn the office inside out, which spells bad news for Gun-su, as his desk drawers are stuffed with money from bribes. In true fast & furious style, he races through the streets of the Korean capital to save his ass. But accidents come in pairs. He has a fatal encounter with a man crossing the street.

And what better place to hide a body than the freshly dug grave of his beloved mother!? And if you think we’ve just told you the entire movie, you couldn’t be more wrong. This is just the beginning of Gun-su’s troubles.

A Hard Day was a sensation at last year’s Quinzaine des réalisateurs at the Cannes film festival. Director Kim Seong-Hoon has delivered a solid addition to the already impressive pantheon of Korean thrillers. You can expect an adrenaline kick from the first to the very last second."

When her parents take her to a medium, she tells them that she’s possessed by the spirit of a lost soul. Her sister Chi feels guilty; as she was supposed to watch over Ai on the day she drowned. She goes to the village where Ai was found and makes a shocking discovery.

Saigon-born, US-raised director Ham Tran turns to horror for his third feature, a stylish ghost story that was one of last year’s biggest box office successes in Vietnam. Ham sustains a constant sense of threat in the film, turning it from a supernatural story into something much darker socially, presenting us with a relevant and gripping horror tale."

When something goes wrong, special intervention teams are sent to the trouble spot. When one of these teams returns covered in blood and completely psychotic from Infini, the most faraway station known to man, another teams is sent to the mining site to discover what’s going on. 

Australian Director Shane Abbess, who has collaborated on films such as Source Code, Crawlspace (Bifff 2013) and John Doe: Vigilante (Bifff 2014), has realized his dream project. He has created a dark and grim science fiction movie that is a true homage to the scifi films from 30 years ago, when classics such as Blade Runner, Alien and The Thing transgressed visual and thematic borders."

His father regularly abused the female slaves, while his mother even burned one alive to save the family honor. It’s time for some ghostly revenge and this happens to coincide with Rodrigo’s return.

Director Mauricio Brunetti dug deep into Argentina’s past. We’re not talking about the military dictatorship, but about the early years of the still young nation, when civil war raged and slavery was a part of the economy. This gripping blend of historical drama and ghost story, makes you feel as if you’re watching a spooky version of  12 Years a Slave. "

But Ambrose misses the action. Luckily there are rumors about a wild lynx on the premises that make the hearts and pacemakers of the residents beat faster. One evening Ambrose stumbles upon the leftovers from the latest meal of the so-called lynx. They’re the remains of an old lady and of his only friend in the world; Shadow. The police do not believe his story because a blind man is not actually a very reliable source of information. Ambrose’s mind is made up. He will use his last days to get rid of that beast once and for all. 

You’ve probably understood what our hero is dealing with. The villain of Adrian Garcia Bogliano’s first American film is a true horror classic; the werewolf. And the director of I’ll Never Die Alone and Here Comes The Devil has surrounded himself with some very good company: Nick Damici (Stakeland, We Are What We Are, Cold In July) as Ambrose and Robert Kurtzman, the legendary sfx artist of Army of Darkness, Bubba Ho-Tep, From Dusk Till Dawn and many others"

Stanley faces censorship, a storm destroys the set and the colossal egos of Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer crash with each other. Stanley gets replaced by John Frankenheimer, someone who’s more pliable to the wishes of the studio execs, and is banned from the set. Disguised as one of Dr. Moreau’s creatures, he infiltrates the shooting and is a first row witness of how his dream falls apart. 

Lost Soul is a documentary about a movie that never was, at least not the way its director intended it to be. Like previous movies about the same subject (Lost in La Mancha, Jodorowsky’s Dune), this is a film about a director who goes through big studio hell. As often, it’s the story of one man against the machine. Lost Soul is a fascinating and riveting tale about a modern day Don Quixote."

What follows is a breathtaking adventure that perfectly captures the tone, atmosphere and spirit of Lupin.

It took two years to write the script. Shooting took place in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand. Director Ryuhei Kitamura (Versus, Aragami, The Midnight Meat Train) has transferred the live-action adventures of Lupin to a contemporary setting. That’s quite a feat for the grandson of Arsène Lupin, whose first appearance was in the Monkey Punch manga’s at the end of the sixties. Since then, he has become an essential anime stalwart."

There’s a parody on American horror cinema. One has pitch perfect production design, another is pure grindcore. In short, this is one heartily stuffed bloody burrito we’d love to bite in. 

The title of this horror anthology is a perfect declaration of intention. One hundred years after H. Wood’s eponymous movie, upcoming directors of contemporary Mexican cinema present us with a series of shorts that each highlight another cruel aspect of the Latin-American country. The theme and tone of every contribution is always different, but the talent shown in this extreme, bizarre, surreal, absurd, grand guignolesque compilation is undeniable."

Then, one day, he runs into Shuichi, who’s completely immune to his power. Luckily this anomaly seems to be short-lived, as Shuichi gets run over by a truck.  Or is it? Because where there’s a Ying, there’s a Yang. Shuichi returns and he’s dead-set on stopping him once and for all. 

Everybody who knows their J-Horror, will rejoice when hearing that Hideo Nakata has helmed this feature. The master of contemporary horror (Ringu, Dark Water…) mixes themes from his earliest work with that of his later films (Death Note, Chatroom). The bad guy is none other than Tatsuya Fujiwari (Battle Royale, Death Note), while his opponent is a part of Takayuki Yamada (13 Assassins, Gantz).

Utilizing weaponry crafted by an eccentric inventor, Torakage takes on both sides and plays them and their ninja armies off each other in the hope of saving his family.

For nearly two decades Yoshihiro Nishimura has been on the forefront of Japanese “extreme cinema” both as a director and as a special makeup artist. His directorial work includes such films as the groundbreaking Tokyo Gore Police and the zombie epic Helldriver. The Ninja War of Torakage marks a new path for Nishimura, as he blends the popular Japanese ninja genre with his kinetic, visually driven style of filmmaking. The movie stars Takashi Miike regular Takumi Saitoh (13 Assassins, Ace Attorney) as Torakage, with cult-actress Eihi Shiina (The Audition, Tokyo Gore Police) as Torakage’s evil master."

Take the tagline from Parts per Billion: “If the world ends, will love survive?” It starts with a disaster. An unstoppable virus is decimating the planet’s population. The six protagonists of the film, three couples whose intertwined stories are related to the big question posed by the film, make up the balance of their lives and relationships while the End of Everything approaches. But are they just innocent victims of the impending catastrophe, or is there something else going on? 

Do not expect a Roland Emmerich-like apocalyptic spectacle. Parts Per Billion is much more related to the thoughtful movies of Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu and Paul Haggis. People are forced to look back on their lives and face the consequences of their choices. Sundance favorite Brian Horiuchi, the scriptwriter of America So Beautiful and Circle of Eight, has crafted a gripping humanistic drama with some big names in the leads, among whom Gena Rowlands, Josh Hartnett, Rosario Dawson and Frank Langella!"

Twelve ships will have to face a Japanese invasion force of more than 300 ships. What follows is a breathtaking battle that will decide the future of the Korean nation.

This epic super-production broke all box-office records in Korea. And that’s no surprise.

Callan McAuliffe, Geraldine James",,,,,,,90',"Science-Fiction, Action, Adventure",,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2145829/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1,,,,,"It took only a few days for the alien robots to conquer Earth. There’s only one rule. Stay inside or be disintegrated. Where they come from, their reasons for invading and keeping people locked inside are completely unknown. They use human collaborators and deliver food rations at home, but their most powerful tool of control is the implant that everyone has and with which they can track your every move. In a small coastal town in England, four children discover a way to temporarily disable the implants. They’re finally able to go outside again. Maybe they’ll even get to start a rebellion against the Robot Overlords!

Director Jon Wright, to whom we thank Grabbers (BIFFF 2012), has crafted an intense scifi adventure movie for the entire family. Its budget might only been a fraction of that of a Transformers movie, but unlike that giant franchise, it treats its audience with respect and invites them to join in the fun. The four young leads steal the show, getting some big name support from Sir Ben Kingsley (Sexy Beast, iron Man 3) as a villainous robot collaborator and Gillian Anderson (X-Files, The Fall) as their worried mum."

Longtime best friend of mob boss Shawn Maguire, Jimmy, now 55, is haunted by the sins of his past; as well as a dogged police detective who’s been one step behind Jimmy for 30 years. Lately, it seems Jimmy’s only solace can be found at the bottom of a whiskey glass. But when Jimmy’s estranged son Mike becomes a target, Jimmy must make a choice between the crime family he chose and the real family he abandoned long ago. With Mike on the run, Jimmy’s only penance for his past mistakes may be to keep his son from the same fate. Jimmy is certain he’ll face himself… at the wrong end of a gun. Now, with nowhere safe to turn, Jimmy has one night to figure out exactly where his loyalties lie and to see if he can finally make things right.

From Jaume Collet-Serra, director of Non-Stop and Orphan (Golden Raven Bifff 2009) comes a high-octane action thriller with an awe inspiring cast. Liam Neeson (Schindler’s List, The Grey, Taken) leads the pack as Jimmy Conlon. Ed Harris (The Right Stuff, The Abyss) is mob boss Shawn Maguire. Vincent d’Onofrio (Full Metal Jacket, Law & Order) is the man on Conlon’s tail, while Joel Kinnaman (The Killing) plays Mike. The script was written by Brad Ingelsby (Out of The Furnace) and the music was composed by Holland’s finest: Junkie XL (Resident Evil, Mad Max: Fury Road)   "

They call upon Kenshin to save them as he is, of course, the only one who’ll be able to stop Makoto.

Everybody cheered when hearing that the successful adaptation of Rurouni Kenshin from 2012 would get two sequels. This success is based on the cult status of the comic that inspired the movies. Rurouni Kenshin is the tale of Himura Kenshin, a former sword for hire who wants to forget his past by assisting those in need. On his travels he encounters many people from his past, a few friends and a lot of enemies. Takeru Sato one again incarnates Kenshin, while his opponent is played by none other than Tatsuya Fujiwara, the hero from Battle Royale and the bad guy from Death Note and Monsterz. "

In this last chapter Kenshin will have to go all the way to stop Shishio’s plans to overthrow the Meiji government. He’ll meet some old friends and will find support from his master.

The success of this series is for a big part due to the action scenes. In a time where everything is created and enhanced by CGI, it’s a real joy to see actors performing some real fighting choreography. The Japanese movie critics were unanimous with their praise and the gods know how strict they are when it comes to live adaptations of this caliber. The Rurouni Kenshin series is one of the best manga adaptations of this time and doesn’t abandon its fans for a bigger audience. If you love manga, go see this movie. If you love action, go see this movie, if you love Kenshin, definitely go see this movie. And if you’re not dead, there’s really no reason not to go see this movie!"

One day, one of them takes her to an old Victorian house. Before savoring her skills, the guy gives Blue a guided tour of the enormous mansion. He shows her an ancient projector containing strange images. Blue’s curiosity is tickled and, once the job’s done, she starts exploring the house for herself. In one of the rooms she discovers a secret chamber hid behind a huge mirror. Blue finds out that the house was used as a brothel in the 19th century. The owner, an avant-gardist with disgusting habits, was probably the director of the world’s first snuff movie. But that’s not everything. Blue is not alone in the secret chamber…
 
The Sleeping Room is a very atmospheric picture with plenty of old-school gore that reminds you of the Hammer horror movies. All the repressed desires, frustrations and taboos of Victorian society are more than enough inspiration for a chilling feature that will give you sleepless nights."

He manages to stop a passing police car. Is this the end of the affair? No this is just the beginning of a violent and bloody transformation of this peaceful community.

It’s not a coincidence that The Stranger is produced by Eli Roth. Its director, Uruguayan born Guillermo Amoedo has written the scripts for Roth’s The Green Inferno and Knock Knock. His English language debut is an intriguing mystery thriller with some tasty horror goods that slowly builds up tension, culminating in tasty shock moments. The Stranger is serviced by solid acting and writing and is a tense, violent and bloody addition to the genre."

Madam Perch spares no means to destroy the intruders, spraying them with state of the art chemicals. But there’s a nasty sting to the product. It produces quite the opposite effect. The wasps not only survive, they return meaner… and a whole lot bigger. We’re talking from 3 meagre centimeters to three full meters! Madam Perch’s garden party is certainly going to be a big hit this year.

After sheep, snakes and spiders, it’s now finally our friends the wasps who’ll prominently figure in your favorite monster movie nightmares. German director Benny Diez has adapted his famous eponymous short into a fully-fledged long feature. It’s a true homage to VHS-cult classics such as Tremors and Critters in a movie that is very generous with gore and humor. In the leads we find Lance Henriksen and Clifton Collins Jr (Pacific Rim)."

This time he’s not dealing with a prank caller. Yoon smells an opportunity to get back into the spotlights. The terrorist only wants to talk to him and Yoon starts to haggle with his bosses for prime time exposure. But the terrorist tells him that he’s also on the target list. Is the president himself doesn’t show up in the studio, Yoon’s earpiece is going to blow up… along with him and the rest of the office.

The Korean action thriller The Terror Live takes place entirely in a radio studio and ingeniously uses this closed location to pump up tension and suspense from the very beginning to the spectacular end. The movie also has a solid backbone, lashing out against the merciless hierarchy and tough working conditions in Korean companies, the ruthless drive for higher ratings and the corruption and cronyism plaguing the higher layers of society. Korean superstar Jung-woo Ha (The Chaser, The Yellow Sea) plays the opportunist anchorman who gets caught in his own game. "

Australian director Zak Hilditsch thought long and hard about it, got behind the camera and filmed the following answer: you abandon your pregnant girlfriend, sniff a few lines of coke, get behind the wheel to the biggest and last orgy in town and consume every possible drug you can find on the way.

During these final hours, James, the protagonist of Hilditsch’s movie, witnesses the best that humanity has to offer: murder, rape, collective suicides and pedophiles having a go at a girl abandoned by her parents. And why not, there’s no tomorrow… ever again! But James’ conscience starts to gnaw at him and he begins to act. Where will it lead him, just before our planet gets its final goodbye?"

Is there still room for a dishonest, disgusting, misogynist cop like Torrente or has the world really gone to hell!?
 
This is the fifth part of one of the most successful Spanish franchises of all time. Mission Eurovegas is the sequel to Lethal Crisis and was last year’s biggest box office success in Spain, even beating the big Hollywood blockbusters. With the right mix of politically incorrect humor, a fun cast (Alec Baldwin as the bad guy) and lots of action and spectacle, Torrente will not run out of steam in the years to come. Take a bit of Lethal Weapon, a whiff of Die Hard and spice it up with humor from The Hangover and you’ll know what you’re in for."

He wants to devote himself to his biggest passion; the search for relics from the past: comics, Rubik cubes and Game Boys. When Apple’s kidnapped, Kid is forced to put his gaming skills to the test and face Zeus and his biker boys.

The villagers, having dug a deep moat to defend them from the rest of the world, share a naive belief that they could save themselves from evil, failing to understand that evil has made its nest in their souls and is waiting for an opportunity to gush out upon the world.

Pan’s Labyrinth meets Gogol in Viy 3D, the long awaited remake of the movie classic from 1967, itself based on a classic Russian horror story. Director Oleg Stepchenko has spared no expense or effort to lift the film to a higher level. Viy 3D is a delicious, fantastic and scary fairytale with an international cast (Jason Flemyng, Charles Dance) and creatures that are as strange as they are original."

The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom is based on a classic of Chinese literature, the eponymous novel by Liang Yushen. It was adapted numerous times by, among others, Ronny Yu (The Bride of Chucky). This time Jacob Cheung (Battle of the Warriors) had a go at the immortal classic.

It almost looks like the first part of Interstellar, but nobody gets catapulted into space to save mankind. 

Young Ones is an ambitious project that’s visually stunning and benefits from a strong cast. You know Michael Shannon from Jeff Nichols’ movies like Shotgun Stories and Take Shelter and from TV’s Boardwalk Empire. Elle Fanning made quite an impression in Sofia Coppola’s Somewhere and Kodi Smit-Mc Phee debuted as Viggo Mortensen’s son in The Road. Director Jake Paltrow also delivers great work. He fills his impressive sets with tension and inventive sfx and creates a universe that reminds you at the same time of science-fiction films from the seventies and westerns."

Yes, it’s true. Taiwanese director Joey Chien has a subscription to the BIFFF. After Zombie 108 (2013) and The Apostles (2014), he’s back with Zombie Fight Club. This is no horror homage to David Fincher’s cult classic Fight Club, but more something like The Raid meets Resident Evil meets Highschool of the Dead. Do not expect lots of dialogue and a complicated plot. Tons of gore, scantily clad zombies and meat mincers as weapons are Zombie Fight Club’s forte.

He directed The Howling with Dee Wallace and the best segment from The Twilight Zone, co-directed with Steven Spielberg, George Miller and John Landis.

2015,event,Zombifff Day,,8th Zombie Day & Night - Zombifff Lympics,,,,,"THE DISCIPLINES

SPINAL CORD THROWING
Power, concentration, courage … the participating zombies will need all these qualities to finish this discipline.
You need more explanation? Really? 
You take the spinal cord and you THROW it as far as possible in front of you. Try not to lose your arm while throwing…

RUNNING 
A simple discipline. You only have to run 100 meters. And because we’re so nice, we’ve even reduced the number of meters to run. 
One has to realize that not all zombies are bitten equal. If some are as fortunate to be more or less in one piece (or seem to be), others are a lot less lucky: a leg or two torn off, intestines hanging out, no eyeballs (but can zombies actually still see something?), a half-eaten arm… But don’t worry. It’s just a few meters, you’ll manage.
The discipline starts with a roll of the Dice of Destiny. This will determine which part of your body you’re not allowed to use during the discipline. Fingers crossed it’s going to be your arms!

INTESTINE PULLING
A miserable, screaming human (that seems to be hugely motivating) with its intestines hanging out, is the stake of an argument between two rival zombie teams.
Six on one side, six on the other side and a cord of intestines… which team is going to get to eat him?
A trial of force to be completed by an entire team of competing zombies.
Please show some understanding for the miserable, screaming human. You’re playing with his intestines.

ATTACKING HUMANS
The participating zombies are hungry and what do you know? A bunch of yummy humans are at the other side of the field.
But chances are they’re not going to be very cooperative. Armed with stones, they’ll try to push back the advancing zombies. Every time a zombie gets hit, he has to go back to the starting line. Will the zombies be flexible and agile enough to avoid getting stoned?

REGULATIONS or how to behave like a good zombie
It goes without saying that all disciplines must be completed in a true spirit of fair play. Zombies HELL YEAH, but well educated zombies!
Every infraction to the rules can be sanctioned by the jurors at each discipline.
Sanctions can go from a simple loss of points to total, complete and irrevocable disqualification from the competition.
We ask you to: 
Respect the other teams...
… and also respect your own team members! A bought friend is also a friend for life…
Do not bite your opponents.
Be nice to the jurors (biting the jury may lead to disqualification!)
Respect basic decency rules (we know it’s difficult, but the King is just across the street!)
Do not throw your garbage, intestines, maggots or rotting limbs on the ground or at your opponents and certainly not at the jurors and the MC’s.
Realize it’s just a game. A sane mind in a healthy body is fine… but in a decaying body is even better, don’t you think?                                                                  Once again, Cheap Satanism Records and Café Central join forces for a rhythmic limb swinging ritual at the 5th ZomBIFFF Night. This year the party kicks off under an occult sign with the presentation of the latest albums by Alos and Solar Skeletons. Alos is the brainchild of Italian performance artist Stefania Pedretti, who has no equal in bringing her audience into a diabolic and Machiavellian trance. The duo Solar Skeletons are true apprentice-sorcerers, whose spells consists of audio-explosions that are going to knock you out. If there are still some undead alive after all that, Agent Palmer, dDash en Tzii will deliver the final blow with some diabolic spins to the turntables.

By the way, Café Central extends the ZomBIFFF Night by inviting you every Sunday evening in April to watch a zombie movie at the occasion of their habitual movie-club evenings. Entrance is also free. This year they’ll try to answer the question that is haunting every decaying brain: can zombies have romantic adventures or are they doomed to rot away watching Oprah Winfrey reruns?!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once again, fans of all ages pull out all stops to bring to life their favorite characters. In cosplay, people from all walks of life get in touch with their crafty sides and recreate the costumes of their favorite characters. For competitions, in addition to their hand crafted costumes, the cosplayers take to the stage to showcase their work and pay tribute to their fandoms with short performances. While the costumes are expected to be as accurate as possible, the performance gives them more creative freedom and can range from dramatic reenactments to humoristic dances. 

Last year our talented judges picked Cyanide to join Cyclone X in representing Belgium at the EC finals in London 2014.     
This year, we have a special treat for our regular visitors: in addition to the 5th Belgian EuroCosplay, we are also bringing you the selections for Season 5 of the European Cosplay Gathering.

As you may know, the EuroCosplay selections gives 44 European cosplayers representing different countries to compete against each other in a battle of craftsmanship at the finals held at the end of October during the MCM London ComicCon.
  

For the European Cosplay Gathering, one solo representative and one group from 11 different countries take part in the finals that organized in each July during Japan Expo in Paris. Boasting the best cosplay stage in Europe, the competition gives contestants the opportunity to present fantastic performances in a crowd of over ten of thousands of people. 
At both events, the participants receive free trips to the respective finals and the marvelous opportunity to become part of the warm and welcoming European Cosplay Community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thanks to these developments, we are getting more and more small but interesting work produced that deserves more than a few clicks on the internet. Ten years ago, Courts Mais Trash was created to put these films in theatres and on the big screen. We thought it would be great to show our audience the work these guys have been doing for the last couple of years. To go against the classic way of producing a movie is one thing; to get the movies into theatres is quite another. Self production is maybe easy to make, but not easy to distribute. The internet is a handy tool to get those first clicks and to build an audience. But the internet is often too big for a small movie and it gets lost in an endless sea of information. It’s always more rewarding for a director to see his film on a big screen in a real theatre. That is the goal of Courts mais Trash. The trash doesn’t only stand for gore movies but for a kind of movie that is radical, alternative, different, politic or cheap …",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the success of games is ever growing and a part of our audience has an affection with videogames, we thought that it wouldn’t be a bad idea to turn it into an OFF-festival event. Those who visited the festival during the nineties, might have memories of the LAN-Parties. This year we changed that concept a little. Now you don’t play LAN at one single location. You can cherish these little pleasures at many geek-spots in Brussels. Try to break Speedrun-records, fear the night with DeadLight, get to know the world of videogames through a Masterclass and a documentary, survive a night full of party games around zombies, participate in our Survivial Horror retrospective, meet the developers in a unique setting or gain prizes during tournaments of Super Smash Bros and Call Of Duty Zombies.
This will all be organized during the festival by day. Come in great numbers, discover the new geek-spots of Brussels and win tickets for the festival!

Synthésis Workshop is an event that explains in an interactive manner what special effects are. Jean-Yves Arboit is the master of ceremonies. His explanation will this year be spread over two days.

The first day he’ll explain the different stages out of which a 100% digital effects shot consists. Step by step, from a blank paper to the finished product, Jean-Yves will demonstrate how easy, accessible and powerful these techniques are and how high their artistic potential really is. This masterclass will focus on the work of Georges Lucas and Pixar and will show you how it can inspire your own productions.

The second day consists of two parts. The first part will explain in a practical manner how you can make your movie with limited means and with software that’s accessible to everyone. The second part consists of an open forum focused on the projection of a completely digital sfx short feature and its “making off”. On the menu a Q&A about all the production stages of this movie. A film explained from A to Z!

As a bonus, one of Jean-Yves’ old students, who now works in the sector, will share his experience and will explain the first steps that lead from getting your degree to a career in the film industry


Finally, the Synthésis Workshop team will be present during the festival at the BIFFF “village” and will be at our disposal for council and support for your digital sfx scenes, whether it’s for a first movie or project, financed or not.

How science-fiction cinema represents the judge
Justice has always been a big theme in the science-fiction universe, especially in movies about a dystopian future. Strangely enough, we hardly ever see a judge in these kinds of films. What does a society looks like when there are no judges? What happens when the judge is replaced by a computer or a robot? Or when the government chooses to outsource the legal system to a private contractor? Or even when society blindly trusts a technology that can prevent crime? Whether it’s about societies reverting to a more primitive state or driven by technological progress, science-fiction shows us a broad view of possible futures and questions our systems of justice. 
From Judge Dredd to Minority Report, the Human Rights League will try to understand through film why future societies no longer see any use for judges. It’ll make us realize how fast things are already changing now and how our society isn’t that far removed from a dystopian vision of the world.

Hell at the gates!


What is the place of the zombie in our collective consciousness? Why do they fascinate us so much? When and in what shape do they appear in our lives? Those are the questions I’ve been asking myself for months now while making a series of small oil paintings featuring the undead. 
Anthropophagy, cannibalism, fear for the hereafter and for trespassing our limits… the zombie-theme keeps inspiring writers, directors and artists.
While creating these works, I’ve injected them with lots of humor. 

Some works are in a figurative style bursting with color. They are presented as the typical American publicity billboards from the 60ties. Playful and deliberately naive – rosy cheeked kids devouring adult corpses when they’re not being pursued by zombies themselves – the zombie-theme is given a fresh perspective. Other works, in more sober colors, portray zombies with a lot more “bite”!

Whether it’s zombies or disfigured humans, no one will remain indifferent while watching these creatures suffer. The portraits of this Persona Non Grata will expose them to the audience no holds barred!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
