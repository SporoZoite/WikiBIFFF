Emma is a writer, poet, musician and … blind. This was the result of a severe beating by her disturbed mother during her formative years. She overcame this blow by expressing her world of touch, smell, and sound through her work. Now, however, Emma gets the opportunity to see again through an eye transplant. It is a success, but before she can see again, Emma first goes through a transitional phase, in which she suffers from retrograde vision. Her brain is only able to relay what she sees after 12 hours. What is so unique about that? Well, barely back from the hospital, a woman is murdered, and Emma has seen it … 12 hours late. The cynical, burger-eating detective Hallstrom thinks the girl is a bit too unworldly to be an efficient witness. But as more and more women are murdered, the two team up to investigate. They discover the hair-trigger scheme behind the murders, and Emma could well be the crowning glory.

Jackson, Michael Rapaport",,,,,,,119',"Crime, Drama, Romance",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0108399,?ref_=nm_knf_t3",,,,,"First, there is Clarence Worley, a comic book salesman, comic book eater and almost a comic book character himself. He is as mad as a hatter and passionate about karate films and Elvis the Pelvis. Secondly, there is Alabama Whitman, an ambitious and passionate girl, who makes a living as a lady of the streets. Clarence + Alabama = FIREWORKS! The two become steeped in each other. After a crime, committed in their youthful hubris, they flee together for a hellish trip from grey Detroit to sunny L.A. In the boot are several kilos of coke simmering, a load coveted by many ugly and sinister people. The father of Clarence (Dennis Hopper), an old policeman, wants to protect his wild son. The white Rasta dealer (Gary Oldman), who imagines himself to be black, sees the fake nosebleeds shining before his eyes. And there is an experienced mafioso (Christopher Walken), who has not cold-cocked anyone in 10 years.

True Romance is the explosive result of the collaboration between the sophisticated Brit Tony Scott (Top Gun, The Hunger) and the new Hollywood prodigy Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs). Tarantino stands for spectacularly tough dialogue from real-life cartoon characters, larded with masses of references to the music and films of the seventies. Add to this the visual flair of Tony Scott, who for the first time in his career was granted the right to a final cut, and you have a film that makes your mouth water. The final blow is delivered by the rows of brilliant actors. Christian Slater (Singles) and Patricia Arquette (The Indian Runner, Trouble Bound) as the Bonnie and Clyde of the 90s. Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, Blue Velvet) is the father, Gary Oldman (Dracula, Prick Up Your Ears) the dealer and Christopher Walken (At Close Range, The Milagro Beanfield War) the Mafiosi. Without forgetting Val Kilmer (Top Gun, The Doors), Brad Pitt (Thelma & Louise, Arizona Dream) and Chris Penn (Reservoir Dogs)."
1994,movie ,International Competition,,THE CLUB,Brenton Spencer,1994,Canada,,International Competition,"J.H. Wyman, Kim Coates, Andrea Roth",,,,,,,90',Horror,,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0109449,?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_31",,,,,"In a stately mansion, a few well-bred young people are celebrating. The usual speeches follow in quick succession, the champagne corks pop and people politely wait their turn at the toilets. There is nothing wrong with that. Until some unexpected and inexplicable events occur. A young guest (of whom the partygoers are unaware that he committed suicide a few years ago) urges an idiot to kill him. And that will be the catalyst for an explosion of spectacular and bloody violence. The mansion becomes a trap. The doors close, the corridors become a labyrinth. One by one, the partygoers disappear without tracks. Those who remain are sentenced to wander in endless corridors guarded by sculpted monsters. The members of the “club” have fallen into a devilish trap. Their most terrible nightmares are coming true. The suspicion creeps up on them that this diabolical symphony has been orchestrated by one of the members of the club, someone who can manipulate the course of time, who can change destiny. Someone who must have very good relations … with Hell.
The Club is Brenton Spencer’s debut. The film revolves around the old but not worn-out theme of a group in the grip of a collective nightmare. A nightmare that leads to mass hysteria, and opens the doors to an invisible, dark Lovecraftian world. Encouraged by the enthusiasm of a few young actors, who cheerfully die in Technicolor on the big screen, this is a Canadian horror product that makes its mark.."

One evening, Beth returns home alone, forgetting that Jonathan had promised her an evening at the opera, and catches a real burglar. With more luck than sense, she manages to put the miscreant out of action. To her great dismay, she discovers that the thief is Jonathan’s best friend. Like all married men, he can explain everything. Together with his friend, he had staged a robbery to get some much-needed cash from the insurance company. Beth, being a good wife, decides to keep her mouth shut and go along with the scam. Soon she will regret this decision. Roland Copping (Phil Collins), the shrewd and eccentric insurance man, immediately sees through their little game. But instead of turning them in, he begins to blackmail them with diabolical pleasure until they are no longer sure they can even call their underwear their own. Copping’s torture drum of games and pranks seems inexhaustible. But the couple have no intention of letting themselves be done and deploy a deadly array of gadgets against their tormentor.

Australian Stephan Eliott’s debut is a true mishmash of genres. The film moves easily from thrillers to dark comedy over slapstick back to thrillers. The role of Machiavellian eternal child is right up Phil Collins’ (many records and CDs, Buster) street. Hugo Weaving (Proof) and Josephine Byrnes (Brides of Christ) give him appropriate resistance. And that is not least thanks to the gadgets by set designer Brian Thompson, who already demonstrated his skills with Toys. Frauds is a pleasant surprise package, which is also full of unexpected tricks and turns on the camera. In short, this is a worthy cross between the universe of Beetlejuice and that of Doctor Caligari."

In Belgrade, many young people would do anything to escape military service. Aleksa, a young journalist, is one of them. When two of his friends have already returned in body bags, Aleksa switches to the night shift to escape the army recruiters. When they get too close on his trail, he seeks refuge in the house of the mysterious Mrs. Kosara, his colleague on the night shift. She entrusts him with cataloguing the books in her “wohnzimmer,” a library of priceless value. Aleksa becomes suspicious when Alimpiya, Kosara’s boarder, tells him that for three centuries this huge arsenal of knowledge has been collected and hidden from possible readers. He is also visited in his dreams by his dead friends, who warn him about Kosara and Alimpiya. Aleksa comes to the shocking realisation that the two are vampires, and through bribed ambulance drivers get their supply of young, full-blooded men. However, the two are on to him and offer him the choice of fighting in the war or becoming one of them.

For two years, director Zoya Todoric and scriptwriter Petar Grujivic worked on their film in a Serbia plagued by corruption, hyperinflation, censorship, fuel, and food shortages. The film could be interpreted as a hidden criticism of the powerful of the world. Kosara and Alimpiya suck the blood out of young war victims and bury them in lead coffins, so that the young vampires will never get out of their graves and are doomed to haunt the dreams of their loved ones forever. Moreover, they refuse to share the knowledge of their incredible library with the people. Who cannot see the connection with politicians who want to keep their people dumb at all costs and are prepared to sacrifice an entire generation as cannon fodder. Fantastic Film as the last bastion of the free spirit. At your festival again this year."
1994,movie ,International Competition,,GHOST IN THE MACHINE,Rachel Talalay,1993,USA,,International Competition,"Karen Allen, Chris Mulkey, Ted Marcoux",,,,,,,95',"Horror, Science-Fiction, Thriller",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0107009,?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_61",,,,,"After a spectacular accident in a hospital, serial killer Karl Hochman (Ted Marcoux) acquires almost endless power. Under a scanner, his deranged mind is transformed into a computer virus. He ends up in the central computer, which is connected to the largest data network in the United States. Anything electronic—from ordinary household appliances to complex computer networks—can be used as an instrument of murder. Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) was already high on Hochman’s list when he was still “in the flesh”, and now enjoys the dubious honour of becoming the electronic serial killer’s first unwilling target. Bram Walker (Chris Mulkey), a computer expert with the FBI, helps her in the fight against the digital menace. They are faced with the impossible task of finding the maniac, and above all, devising a way to eliminate him.

You’ll never trust your toaster like you used to after seeing Ghost in the Machine, a techno-thriller from Rachel Talalay (Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare). Talalay was previously the producer of two frenzied comedies by John Waters, Hairspray and Cry Baby. Here, she skilfully plays on our fears and dependencies in the computer age. Computers and vulgar objects begin to emanate the same menace as the birds in Hitchcock’s The Birds. The screenplay is by the duo William Davies & William Osborne, who have already made Twins, Stop, or my Mom will shoot and Earthquake. Karen Allen (Starman, Malcolm X, King of the Hill) sees her kitchen turn into a deadly trap. Chris Mulkey (Twin Peaks, The Hidden, Dreamscape) must live up to his reputation as a computer wiz. And Ted Marcoux (L.A. Law) makes his film debut as the bad guy Karl Hochman. The special effects are by Video Image (Batman Returns, Alien III)."
1994,movie ,International Competition,,JACK BE NIMBLE,Garth Maxwell,1993,New Zealand,,International Competition,"Alexis Arquette, Sarah Smuts-Kennedy, Bruno Lawrence",,,,,,,95',"Horror, Thriller ",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0107242,?ref_=nm_knf_t1",,,,,"Jack (Alexis Arquette) and Dora (Sarah Smuts-Kennedy) are abandoned by their parents as children. Dora ends up with a childless suburban couple, while Jack ends up with a sadistic farming family. As he grows up, he endures the daily humiliations and torments of the farmer, his insane wife and their four sinister daughters. As soon as he feels strong enough, he takes terrible revenge on his tormentors and flees the farm in search of Dora. The latter is also desperate for Jack, without whom she feels incomplete. Dora is psychic, but she cannot control her powers. She flees into drink, until she finds peace in the arms of Teddy (Bruno Lawrence), an older psychic. Jack and Dora find each other again and decide to look for their parents, to find out why they were separated. Dora soon discovers that there is something deeply wrong with her brother. Jack can only express himself through violence and is not at all fond of Teddy. And Jack’s four disturbed half-sisters are out for revenge and track them down.

A painful childhood memory of a friend, who was beaten with barbed wire if he did not behave, formed the basis for this handsome debut film by the young New Zealand director Garth Maxwell. His thrilling screenplay is brilliantly carried by the two leading actors. Alexis Arquette (brother of Rosanna and Patricia and seen in Last Exit to Brooklyn and Of Mice and Men) plays a psychopath for whom one can feel sympathy. Sarah Smuts-Kennedy (An Angel at my Table and The Footstep Man) is his troubled sister Dora, his support and anchor. Veteran Bruno Lawrence (The Quiet Earth, The Lost Tribe) also joins the cast as Teddy, Dora’s lover."

The main “players” are Zi-yang, leader of the legendary Wu Dang mountain clan, and Ji Wushuang, a Siamese twin monster who holds sway over the rival Mo clan. Zi-yang has the apple of his eye, Yi-hang, a poor orphan who was raised by him to be a brilliant martial artist. Despite his talent, the boy is a full-blooded pacifist, and when Master Zi-yang goes to war with a coalition against the Mo’s, Yi-hang refuses to accompany him. And that seems to be a wise decision, as in the middle of the battle a mysterious long-haired beauty suddenly appears and single-handedly gives the Wu Dang the beating of their lives. Yi-hang, unaware of the defeat of his own, runs into her a little later. The sparks fly and they fall in love. When it comes time to fight again, Lian, for that is her name, refuses to kill Yi-hang. Together they decide to flee the Community of Swords. However, the Siamese monster twins are not so keen and send all their powers to the lovers.

Jiang-Hu is not only one of the best sword films of recent years, but also a representative of a new genre: costumed kung-fu tragedy. In a single sentence, based on mythical and historical legends, it features broad-scale, razor-sharp choreographed battles in exotic landscapes in opulent costumes. The fact that the endless geographical possibility of “communist” China has been exploited in recent years is no surprise. Director Ronny Yu constantly finds a balance between action and romance in this epic battle opera, juggling Ken Russellian images and Shakespearean themes. The hyperkinetic, omnipresent camera produces unreal and fairy-tale images. The eye-catching costumes were designed by Oscar winner Emi Wada and the lead feature two of Hong Kong’s finest contemporary actors, Leslie Cheung (Yi-Hang) and Lin Ching-hsia (Lian)."

The proud result: Man’s Best Friend. And it goes like this: after years of genetic engineering, our sadistic friends at the FBI have bred the ultimate pit bull: Max. He bites off heads, sends Sergei Boebka into early retirement, and accelerates faster than a Japanese superbike. Max is the ideal wet dream of every dictator devoted to the sacred interests of the free market. As long as the animal is slurping up its daily hormonal fruit pudding, it remains a good woof, but as soon as the feeding stops… You guessed it, our little dog will freak out, thanks to Lori Tanaka, local Gaia representative. She is outraged when, attracted by rumours of animal abuse in the university’s research lab, she finds Max chained up. Lori frees the animal and takes him lovingly into her home. Because the outside world must not know about the unsavoury practices of the FBI, the disappearance is not made public. It is therefore to be hoped that Max is found before the chemicals in his body begin to ferment. Or wouldn’t it be much more interesting to see what a superdog is capable of tearing apart, mutilating and destroying.

What more is there to say? This is madcap fun, written and directed by John Lafia and with special effects by Kevin Yagher (Nightmare on Elm Street 4, Child’s Play 2 & 3). Dog lovers are only allowed into the theatre with a muzzle."

Protagonist is Mikaela, and she is no ordinary girl. She is in love with her literature teacher and writes him erotic essays teeming with hints that would make even Quentin Crisp's ears go pink. The object of her desire responds appropriately… But with another woman. To top it all off, Mikaela is plagued daily by clairvoyant visions that are filled with reprehensible violence. Soon terrible things begin to happen at the school. Girls are murdered. Mikaela’s visions come true. She herself bravely continues her literary outpourings to her beloved teacher. She keeps a close eye on him and suspects that her platonic lover-boy is responsible for the death of one of the students. But at the same time, she feels observed by a stranger. The game begins to get out of hand and comes to a violent climax on the celebration of the annual Lucia night, the shortest night of the year. But for some, it will seem as if the shortest night will never end.

The Premonition is an exciting psychological thriller based on a script by writer Carina Rydberg. Director Rumle Hammerich crafts a clever story about the thin and fragile line between imaginary events and harsh reality. And, for those who would like to see it, Tovan Magnusson plays Mikaela and Figge Norling is Joakim, the teacher."
1994,movie ,"International Competition, Liege Night",,RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 3: ASHES TO ASHES,Brian Yuzna,1993,USA,,International Competition,"Kent McCord, James T. Callahan, Sarah Douglas",,,,,,,97',Horror,,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0107953,?ref_=nm_flmg_prd_17",,,,,"Curt and Julie are two lovers on the run. When they have a motorbike accident and Julie doesn’t survive, a desperate Curt drags her to a secret army base, where his father, a tough military man, conducts experiments on our friends, the living dead. The humanitarian intent behind this is to turn them into deadly bioweapons. Curt administers the life-enhancing liquid to Julie, unaware of the disgusting side-effects of the stuff. This soon becomes clear when the resurrected Julie develops a burning desire for a juicy piece of human flesh. The only thing that can stop the hunger is pain, so that after a while she starts to look like Pinhead’s sister. Curt, not wanting to forsake his love, flees with her. However, they are not only pursued by a vengeful youth gang, where Julie had briefly sunk her teeth, but also by the unscrupulous Colonel Sinclair, who has side-lined Curt’s father. She wants to capture Julie for further experimentation. It seems only a matter of time before hunger will prevail over pain, and Julie will turn on Curt.

This third Living Dead is without a doubt the best of the three. Brian Yuzna, who has already gained a reputation for innovative horror films such as Re-Animator, From Beyond, and Necronomicon, taps into new sources in the zombie genre with this tragic horror love story. Julie is a unique creation, the deadly beautiful undead, for whom one can feel both sympathy, fascination and (for the body piercers among us) inspiration. Mindy Clarke (Young Goodman Brown, Under the Collar) is a fatally fierce Julie. Trevor Edmond (For Keeps, Fatal Charm) plays her desperately sweet Curt. And Kent McCord (Predator II, Airplane II) is Curt’s dad, struggling with parental communication issues. The special effects are by Oscar winner Steve Johnson (The Abyss, Batman Returns, Freddy IV, …). Simply highly recommended!"

Prescott, who had already bought Awbonnie from MacCree, now wants to buy her sister, Valeda, a stunt horse rider, thinking she is the only one who can lift Talbot out of his misery. MacCree’s son, however, opposes the deal, so Prescott runs off with Valeda. At the funeral tree, Awbonnie’s spirit rises from her body and asks Talbot to let her body be devoured by the wild beasts so that her soul can enter the spirit world. He refuses, causing the ghost to rage and demand justice for “Silent Tongue,” Awbonnie and Valeda’s mother.

Sam Shepard, one of the best contemporary American playwrights (Paris, Texas, Fool for Love, Zabriskie Point) and actors (The Right Stuff, Frances, Thunderheart), also establishes his reputation as a great director with Silent Tongue. Like Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven, he redefines the classic western and lays bare the relationships between the Native Americans and the whites. A brilliant cast gives shape to his vision. Alan Bates (Far from the Madding Crowd, The Go-Between, Secret Friends) is the charlatan of the Medicine Show. Grey eminence Richard Harris (A Man Called Horse, Mutiny on the Bounty, Unforgiven) plays devoted father Prescott. One can also see River Phoenix (Stand By Me, My Own Private Idaho, Indiana Jones, and the Last Crusade) once again as a grieving husband. Sheila Tousey (Thunderheart, Slaughter of the Innocents) is the angry ghost Awbonnie, caught between the dead and the living."

His bosses send him to Salt Lake City, in the desert state of Utah, to investigate an exceptionally brutal murder of two children. Broderick, however, already has an inkling of what’s going on. His secret weapon, his 11-year-old son Jesse—like all boys his age, a computer prodigy—has discovered a link in the FBI’s computer with a series of brutal murders that have plagued Monument Valley for 15 years. Armed with this knowledge and assisted by the usual fresh-faced and ambitious assistant Roxanne Lemar (Sheila Tousey), the father goes on a massive manhunt in the Badlands. Meanwhile, the son has discovered new data and, a little too enthusiastically, goes in search of the killer himself. Before long, Broderick is caught up in an explosive race against time to find a crazed religious serial killer, and … to save his son.  

Inspired by true events from the land where religion, commerce and madness can take on 1001 unsavoury forms, seasoned action director James Glickenhaus (The Exterminator, Shakedown, McBain) brings us with his latest film a thrilling combination of high-tech tracking techniques and traditional sleuthing. The always formidable Scott Glenn (Silverado, The Silence of the Lambs, The Hunt for Red October) incarnates living legend Stephen Broderick. Sheila Tousey (Thunderheart, The Silent Tongue) is young colleague Roxanne Lemar, who for once doesn’t fall in love with the older, more experienced partner. And Darlanne Fluegel (To Live and Die in L.A., Pet Sematary II) also gets to do something as Broderick’s wife. The eye-catching photography is the work of Mark Irwin (Videodrome, The Fly, Robocop II)."

Two ghosts, Lilly, and Ruthie, haunt a dilapidated shack behind a dingy pub, The Rose of Erin. Supernaturally, they are linked to a rocking chair in which they both died prematurely. Lilly (Marianne Faithfull) was the wife of Frank (Seymour Cassel), the gruff manager of The Rose of Erin, who killed her in a fit of jealousy. Ruthie (Rachel Bella) was a small innocent girl from a faraway land. The two ghosts move when Sheila (Maggie O’Neil), a character dancer in The Rose of Erin, saves the chair from Frank’s tantrums and presents it to Marty (Alfred Molina), the owner of her flat. Marty is a 40-something jazz musician and music teacher, who, out of inveterate worldliness, doesn’t pay attention to Sheila’s wistful glances. When the two rocking chair ghosts explore their new home, they turn out to get on well with Marty and Sheila. They will become the instruments of Lilly’s revenge on Frank.

This charming low-budget production is a fantastic comedy in the vein of Jules Dassin’s The Canterville Ghost (1944) and Jacques Tourneur’s Cat People (1942). Director Sara Driver, a good friend and regular collaborator of Jim Jarmusch, made her first feature film, You are not I, based on a book by Paul Bowles, in 1982. Her second, Sleepwalk, from 1986, was a fantastic film about a woman translating a mysterious Chinese manuscript. When Pigs Fly, a much-noticed feature at the Locarno Festival, shows how death often sharpens our appreciation for the most trivial things in life. Driver plays to its heart’s content with the clichés of the genre and can count on the fine acting performances of Seymour Cassel (In the Soup), Alfred Molina (Kiss of the Spider Woman) and Marianne Faithfull (Heart-breaking Pictures and Turn of the Screw).

This idealistic dreamer, who behaves like an exiled European aristocrat, is a master of illusions and of seducing women. But it is his neglected wife Penny (Lolita Davidovich) who diligently runs everything. One day, when Jonathan is making love to a customer on the keyboard of a Wurlitzer organ, Penny, who could observe it all from a surveillance camera, has a heart attack on the spot at the sight of this carnal mischief. Son Winston (Brandon Fraser), returning from his studies in England, soon realises that Dad is in no position to run the business. Moreover, Jonathan starts having visions of his wife. Everywhere he hears her voice, and every time he sees her, she seems to have gotten younger and younger.

Los Angeles is the setting for Percy Adlon’s latest film, a delightfully funny and absurd erotic fantasy. This new exploration of the special universe of the creator of Bagdad Café and Rosalie Goes Shopping was a real family affair. He wrote the script with his son, and it was his wife who produced everything. As always, it is, according to him, about “how wonderful women really are, and how stupid men (sic) are.” In any case, he has assembled a splendid cast for it. Donald Sutherland (The Dirty Dozen, M.A.S.H., Novecento) plays the great child Jonathan Younger with great pleasure. The delightful Julie Delpy (“Europa, Europa,” “Mauvais Sang,” “Voyager”) is Melodie, his son’s girlfriend, played by Brandon Fraser. Lolita Davidovich (Blaze) is getting younger as Penny and Sally Kellerman (M.A.S.H., Brewster McCloud, That’s Life) is Melody’s mother."

He almost causes a car accident, gets laughed at at work, is barked at by his boss, and fails to open his soul to his great love, scientist Dr. Lisa Fredericks (Helen Slater). Barry works as a technician in the laboratory of Dr. Thadius Moxley (Martin Landeau). This genius has designed the super accelerator, a complex device that makes subatomic particles run faster than light. The result: endless, untamed energy. The very interesting side effect: “the timebots.” As soon as the accelerator kicks in, this phenomenon causes time to reverse one day, until we arrive back at the starting point and the whole game starts again, and again and again… Barry sees his opportunity when Lisa gets killed. With the timebots, he might be able to save her and turn his bad day into a holiday. But he runs the risk of getting caught in an endlessly repeating time cycle.

What wouldn’t we all give to go back into the past just once to put right some of our many stupidities? Such a thing is only possible in films, and in films people usually exaggerate. So, it is not one opportunity, but two, three, four, five, six … opportunities. Jack Sholder—Grand Prix of Avoriaz with The Hidden, creator of A Nightmare on Elmstreet II and Renegades—created a romantic science fiction thriller, full of intelligent twists and unexpected complications. Jonathan Silverman (Weekend at Bernie’s) is the clumsy but courageous time-waster Barry Thomas. Seasoned eminence Martin Landeau (Space 1999, Tucker, Crimes & Misdemeanors) is Dr. Thadius Moxley and Helen Slater (Supergirl, Ruthless People, City Slickers) melts hearts as beautiful scientist Dr. Lisa Fredericks."

His muse, Elisa—also the name of his biggest hit with his band “Las Moscas” (The Flies)—has left him. When he wants to commit suicide, a motorbike accident disturbs his last thoughts. The victim, a beautiful girl (Emma Suarez), appears to have lost her memory. When the hospital doesn’t remember her either, Jota seizes the opportunity to pass himself off as her boyfriend. He calls her Lisa and starts projecting his ex-partner onto her. When she can leave the hospital, they both go on a motorbike holiday to the campsite “La Ardilla Roja (The Red Squirrel)”. There, a game of delusion and fabrication begins, complicated by their friendship with the family of a speed-obsessed taxi driver and by a mysterious squirrel who bombards Jota with pinecones at every turn. Lisa, however, has a shady past of her own, and when it surfaces, it is no longer certain who is fooling whom.

For those who didn’t know it yet, we have more film talent walking around in Spain than Mister Almodovar. Julio Medem immediately made a name for himself with his debut Vacas (Cows), about the rival passions of three generations of two families in 19th century Spain, with the cows as silent ruminators. His second film, which he himself calls an “anti-macho parable in the form of a mystery comedy,” is a stylish romantic thriller in which the characters and the audience become swept up into a game of lies and delusion. The film is brimming with narrative and visual twists. People are portrayed from the point of view of objects or animals. Interludes about the red squirrel’s way of life are varied with a parodying video clip. Nancho Novo plays an ex-charismatic rocker with Spanish phlegm. The gorgeous Emma Suarez is Lisa (or is she not now?), and Ella Karejalde wanders around as Lisa’s psychotic ex-boyfriend."

In her dreams, she keeps seeing her father Frank (Donald Sutherland) pushing her mother into their house and locking Karen out. When the door opens again, Mom is dead. Karen’s testimony at the time put Frank behind bars, with only one line on his lips: “I’ll be back.” Karen’s nightmare comes true when Dad gets an early release. After only a few days, the family terminator is at her door. He seems changed and asks his daughter to forget the past. And this seems to work better with the whole village than with Karen. Even her boyfriend Dan is particularly charmed by Frank. When her lover is later found dead, something breaks in Karen and she seeks comfort in her father’s arms. Frank moves in with her and Pete and begins to impose himself on the two. Pete is having fun with his grandfather, and the village community is happy. But can she give Frank the benefit of the doubt?

Director Jonathan Heap drew attention to himself with his short film for television 12:01, which was later made into a film that you can also admire extensively at this festival. His debut is one of those films that starts slowly, then accelerates to a climax that makes the audience tumble off their chairs. His two main actors provide internal fireworks and undercurrent tension. Amy Irving (Crossing Delancey, Carrie, Internal Affairs) plays Karen Braswell, a woman who must get in the ring with the demons of her past. Donald Sutherland (MASH, Novecento, A Dry White Season), whom people sometimes call “Dennis Hopper lite,” is the vengeful manipulator Frank Braswell."

To ease their consciences and restore their peace of mind, they promptly fire their Mexican maid. Things don’t get any better when Shell (Rutger Hauer) shows up. This energetic creep forces himself on the couple by nonchalantly throwing around thinly veiled references to the accident in Mexico. Out of fear, Doug and Lynn are forced to hire him for their furniture business. Soon our pedantic psychopath throws off his cloak and begins terrorising and blackmailing the couple. Their lives become hell. Doug is forced to return to Mexico in search of Shell’s true origins.

Two hours of cat-and-mouse, in which a sociopath wreaks havoc on the idyllic life of a young couple. Work by New Zealand director Geoff Murphy has often been seen at the festival. Utu and the apocalyptic The Quiet Earth caught the eye of Hollywood producers, whereupon he was brought in for Young Guns II and Freejack. In Blind Side, Rutger Hauer (Blade Runner, The Hitcher, Ladyhawke) once again indulges in the role of a psychopath on duty. His victims are two esteemed colleagues who also made a name for themselves playing disturbed characters. Rebecca De Mornay (the psychopathic babysitter from The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Runaway Train, Backdraft) and Ron Silver (the “sicko” from Blue Steel, Reversal of Fortune, Enemies: a Love Story) have to endure Hauer’s dangerous antics as the troubled couple Lynn and Doug.

They have a passionate affair. During the “cigarette-after” Stacy confides in him that an old flame is blackmailing her and her husband. She convinces Harry to get the miscreant out of his nest. Aided by an old friend, Police Sergeant Osgood, Harry manages to find the man in a rundown London hotel … with a bullet hole between his eyes. Things get worse when Harry nearly trips over Osgood’s corpse on the hotel roof. Convinced that Stacy has set him up, he is forced into hiding. He finds himself back in the world of intrigue and murder he left ten years ago. Harry will need all his training and experience to survive.

The unusual combination of visual prodigy Russel Mulcahy (Razorback, Highlander I & II) and born actor Michael Caine (Alfie, Educating Rita, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), who co-produced, resulted in a good old spy-thriller. The Cold War may be over, but the cellars of the so-called victors, our beloved free West, are still haunted by ghosts from the past. Michael Caine shines as Harry, the old spy who, against his will, must get his double cover out of the wardrobe again. He is opposed by Sean Young (Blade Runner, No Way Out, A Kiss Before Dying), the diplomat’s wife who prepares an explosive cocktail of passion and betrayal. Ian Holm (Chariots of Fire, Greystoke, Brazil) shows off all his exciting British appeal as Sir Hector, Harry’s old boss."

This sneaky man trades in a very unique comfort: “life.” For a hefty price he can bring Ed’s mother back to life, and … as good as new. Ed, of course, eagerly accepts. After all, there are still the coins from her life insurance policy. Pattle turns out to be as good as his word. Ed’s dead mother (Miriam Margoyles) does indeed return, much to the latter’s delight.

Little dogs are chased with butchers’ knives and cockroaches suddenly crowd the eclairs and cakes with the coffee. Desperate, Ed goes in search of E.J.Pattle, but does he really want to get Mom back into the ground?

This frenzied black comedy sprang from the perverse mind of Jonathan Wacks (award-winning Powwow Highway, Mystery Date), who managed to assemble a handsome cast. Steve Buscemi (In the Soup, Reservoir Dogs, Barton Fink) is the hopeless mama’s boy. Ned Beatty (Hear my Song, Deliverance, Network) plays the peeping uncle. A.J.Pattle is played by John Glover (Gremlins II: The New Batch, Scrooged) and Miriam Margoyles’ (Age of Innocence, Little Shop of Horrors, I Love You to Death) rendition can only be described as a choking role model for all mothers in the world."

Lucy is unable to prevent the kidnapping of her friend by an amphibious vampire, disturbed in his slumber by all that adolescent splashing. A few miles away, in the tiny village of River Junction, a priest is trying to drown a terrible secret in gallons of alcohol…

Tony Randel is one of the many talented directors who have crawled out from under Roger Corman’s wings to go their own way. He earned his spurs with special effects work on films such as Battle Beyond the Stars, Escape from New York, and Galaxy of Terror. In 1988, he gave birth to his first celluloid baby: Hellraiser II: Hellbound. This was followed by Amityville 1992 and Ticks. Children of the Night was originally intended for the video market but deserved a big screen treatment. Tony Randel provides a clever cocktail of myths and delusion, with the main ingredients being vampirism, exorcism, priests with chastity problems and freakish mutations. The special effects are provided by KNB (Army of Darkness, Darkman, Tales from the Darkside)."

She yearns for the warmth of a real three-dimensional male body. In our world, Cool World is a successful comic strip drawn by Frank Deebs. When this frustrated bachelor suddenly finds himself among his creations, he has the déjà vu of his life. Holli, the main source of his celibate fantasies, makes him stop dead in his tracks. She sees in Frank her chance to break through into flesh and blood.

Nine years after his last film, Cool World is the latest exploration of the psychedelic universe of Ralph Bakshi, best known for Fritz the Cat, Lord of the Rings, Heavy Traffic, and other ground-breaking animation films. He got the idea in 1986, when Mick Jagger asked him to shoot the clip for Harlem Shuffle, a combination of actors and drawn figures. Franck Mancuso Jr (the producer of the Friday the 13th series) provided the financial basis. The result is a mix of horror, film noir, thriller, and classic animation. The wacky decors, the junkie “toons” and the passionate actors put Roger and Jessica Rabbit to shame. Kim Basinger (9&1/2 Weeks, Batman, Blind Date) makes Holli Would “in the flesh” a feast for the eyes.

Everything seems to revolve around a kidnapped boy, who could be the cause of the feud to which his family has fallen prey. His growing identification with the boy makes Vito decide to pull off a crazy stunt.

This edge-of-your-seat action thriller was almost forgotten with the unexpected death of its legendary producer Franco Cristaldi. The award for best film and best director at the Hampton International Film Festival and an enthusiastic reception by critics in Cannes and New York turned the tide. The feature debut of 31-year-old Italian director Carlo Carlei, like the films of John Woo, disproves the notion that only Americans can make films with hairpin bends. Influenced by his great examples Spielberg, Scorcese, Kubrick and Peckinpah, Carlei portrays the action in a breath-taking, almost ballet-like manner. Flight of the Innocent grabs you by the scruff of the neck and does not let go after the first images. Vito is played by Manuel Colao. He is helped by veteran actor Jacques Perrin.

For dessert, a living biped is occasionally devoured. After a while, this starts to get a bit too much. Two men each have their reasons for wanting to catch a glimpse of our Allotheria. Hunter (Stephen McHattie) is a rugged, motorcycle-riding scientist. He wants to capture the subterranean beast because of the medicinal mucus it secretes during its ferocious digging. FBI agent Buckner has little interest in these humanitarian motives. What he wants is revenge, revenge on the creature that once killed his partner. Both men become embroiled in a thrilling search for the super mole, who has his own views on all this unwanted interest.
 
The Dark is the second film by Canadian Craig Pierce (Revenge of the Radioactive Reporter), which will change our view of molehills forever. The creature responsible for it, the Allotheria, is the work of a couple of true zoologists, Ron Stefianiuk and Steve Duncan. With the help of the “animatronics” of Toronto’s Virtual Anatomy Studio, we get to see a beast that is on a par with Steven Spielberg’s dinosaurs. And the actors look at least as lifelike as the monster. Stephen McHattie (Grey Lady Down, The People Next Door) plays Hunter, the tough, photogenic scientist. Brion James (Striking Distance, Nemesis, The Postman Always Rings Twice) is Buckner, the crazed FBI agent.

Our writer, already suspected of murder and with his beloved family in danger, sees only two ways out. Resurrect George Stark in a new novel or confront his “dark half.”

Let’s just say it. The Dark Half is one of the most successful film adaptations of a story by the king of horror Stephen King. This was guaranteed by George A. Romero (Monkey Shines, Night of the Living Dead, Zombie, etc.), who, after Creepshow, worked with King for the second time. This modern Jekyll & Hyde was almost lost to posterity due to the unexpected bankruptcy of the production company Orion. Fortunately, your Festival was able to get hold of a copy for European eyes. Just like in that other excellent adaptation, Misery, a writer is terrorised by his paper creation. Admiring tongue whispers that the grand finale even makes Hitchcock’s The Birds look like shit. Timothy Hutton (Ordinary People, The Falcon and the Snowman, Q and A) delivers a fine double performance as Beaumont-Stark.

Catherine has her own reasons for catching the killer. Matt, however, only has eyes for her. The two are joined by retired boxer Ike “Point Man” Pointer (Clarence Landry). The trio follows the tracks to Richard Welton. But even face to face with the killer, the game is far from over.

Director Nigel Dick (of Deadly Intent … and more than 150 music videos for Frank Sinatra, Guns N’ Roses and ZZ Top, among others) and the producing duo Steve Golin and Sigur Sighvatsson (the men behind Wild at Heart, Candyman and Twin Peaks, among others) offer us a modern metropolitan cocktail of redemption, guilt, frustration and anger. The 1940s look and the ethnically neatly divided “love & violence” guarantee an intense postmodern show. Michael Madsen (Thema & Louise, Reservoir Dogs, Trouble Bound) gets to play a good guy for once, albeit with a lot of personal problems. Lisa Bonet (The Cosby Show, Angel Heart) can finally be admired on the big screen again. Gentleman-killer Richard Welton is more than adequately played by Gary Stretch, ex-European and world middleweight boxing champion. And Clarence Landry, also an ex-fighter, could already be seen in Alien Nation and Mr. Saturday Night."

(Everything Except Shoes), to become spokesman for Noxon, their new fertiliser. Together with friend Ernie he flies to Santa Flan, one of the few countries where the product has not yet been banned. They get a lift from the unsuspecting ecologically correct Julie (Megan Ward) and make the mistake of stopping at “Elijah C. Skuggs Famous Freek Land and Mutant Emporium.” This villain (Randy Quaid) captures tourists and smears them with… Noxon, causing them to mutate into fierce freaks. Skuggs captures the trio and starts experimenting. Julie and Ernie are fused into the first combination of feminist & male chauvinist pig. Ricky ends up as half monster-half clean boy, for lack of Noxon. They join the rest of the motley family and become a popular part of the show. In the best “Freaks” tradition, they decide to rebel against Scuggs and look for an antidote to their unappetizing condition.

This Rock ’n Roll Horror Comedy is the brainchild of the duo Alex Winter and Tom Stern. Winter made a name for himself as Bill from the Bill and Ted films (Wayne’s World avant la lettre) and appeared in The Lost Boys and Rosalie Goes Shopping. Together with comrade Tom Stern, he created the successful black comedy show “The Idiot Box” for MTV-USA and played music videos for big names such as Ice Cube, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Jane’s Addiction. As Ricky, Alex Winter is accompanied by Randy Quaid (The Last Picture Show, The Long Riders, Days of Thunder), Megan Ward (Arcade, Amityville V, Encino Man) and by dazzling guest stars including Morgan Fairchild, Mr. T (The Bearded Lady!) and Keanu Reeves (Juan, The Dog Boy!). Special effects come from our friend Screaming Mad George (Freddy IV, Bride of Re-Animator, Necronomicon).

People call him “the hawk” because he plucks out the eyes of his victims. In the north of England lives Annie (Helen Mirren), an ordinary housewife, with her two children and her husband, Stephen (George Costigan), who is often on the road for his work. News of the murders slowly seeps into people’s living rooms, and horrible doubts begin to creep in on Annie. With growing fear, she checks her husband’s diary and compares the dates of the murders with his absences. Doubts become suspicions; fear turns to terror. Annie’s biggest problem is that she cannot be sure of herself. Perhaps she is sinking into one of those paranoid depressions that invariably beset her after the birth of her children. Her obsessive behaviour is beginning to frighten her children, but she needs to know. Is her husband guilty, or is she drowning in her own paranoia? The police can’t help her, and her friends think she is going crazy. To protect herself and her children, Annie has only one way out…

Whenever there is a serial killer at work, the police are inundated with calls from women claiming that their husband or partner is the culprit. This example of relational trust was the starting point for the book The Hawk. Producer Mark Shivas managed to steal the rights to the story from Steven Spielberg himself. The BBC took care of the necessary money. David Hayman (of the award-winning Silent Scream), known as an unconventional daredevil, made sure the film became an intense psychological drama, constantly shifting between Annie’s alleged insanity and the suspicions against her husband. With the always excellent Helen Mirren (Excalibur, Cal, 2010) who plays the role of Annie and George Costigan as the suspicious husband."

Only through them, with them and in them can Jason be reborn … and die. His black heart, the only thing left of him after the previous episode, comes to life on the autopsy table and drastically forces itself on the body of a reluctant coroner. Once again equipped with hands and legs attached to his body, our masked maniac sets off on a bloody trail of corpses. When an innocent virgin meets an untimely death in the woods, the good people of Crystal Lake begin to feel the heat. Jason is back home. But this time it won’t be so easy. Bounty hunter Creighton Duke, an expert in taking down supernatural serial killers, is determined to make Jason’s ninth life his last. Duke claims to know Jason better than anyone. He knows who he is, where he came from and why he does what he does.

This blood-curdling Friday the 13th fits into the recent tradition of the renewal of sleepy sequels. Producer Sean Cunningham, the spiritual father of Jason and director of the very first part, thought it was time to give the series a new, vital injection. He found the ideal director in debutant Adam Marcus, who literally grew up with the series. As an 11-year-old, he brought coffee around on the set of the first Friday the 13th. This last (?) new Jason enjoys a solid screenplay that for once does not serve to fill the gaps between the slaughtering of love-struck teenage couples. Jason Goes to Hell, the Final Friday goes in search of the dark origins of its protagonist and his recurring incarnations. Kane Hodder, the man behind the mask, takes on Jason’s mutilated skin for the third time. The surprising shock effects are the work of our friends from KNB (Army of Darkness, Darkman, Tales from the Darkside)."

Kate is left alone when lightning strikes during a thunderstorm and the power goes out. Suddenly, a mysterious woman (Miranda Richardson) with bandaged hands and red ballet shoes steps out of the mirror. She persuades Kate to draw three symbols—a line, a cross and a bow—and to give up her soul in exchange for the red shoes. These will lead her through the mirror to another world. A guide (Lindsay Kemp) appears and tells her that the only way back is to call up the symbols while singing.

The Line, the Cross and the Curve is the debut of Kate Bush, the well-known singer who has always stubbornly and successfully followed her own path. Together with Lindsay Kemp of the Lindsay Kemp Dance Company, she transformed her last CD “The Red Shoes” into an energetic feast of colours, music, and dance. Seven songs are used as a guideline in a story that is a homage to the classic film The Red Shoes by Michael Powell and Emerick Pressburger. Miranda Richardson (Dance with a Stranger, Damage, The Crying Game) helps her as the witch in the mirror."

He is warmly welcomed by his beautiful young wife Lauren (Mädchen Amick). Dark secrets bubble to the surface when a certain Reno (Eric Roberts) pays the couple a visit. He is introduced to Paul as Lauren’s brother. Distracted by the involvement of his father’s bank in a money-laundering operation, Paul fails to notice the tension between his wife and Reno. Reno apparently wants a lot more than some sisterly advice. The action explodes when Paul discovers that Reno is Lauren’s first husband, a gangster who ended up in prison thanks to her confession. Reno is determined to pull Lauren out of her fairy-tale existence and blackmail her back into a life of crime.

No matter how fast, wild, and young you are, your criminal past will catch up with you. This is all too true in movies, and certainly in this erotic thriller by William Curran. John— who has already missed out on an Oscar twice— Lithgow’s role as righteous husband Paul Harrington is a far cry from the sardonic thug in Cliffhanger or the psychopathic husband in Raising Cain. Mädchen Amick (Twin Peaks, Sleepwalkers, Dream Lover) can lie and cheat as Lauren to the point of flying off the page. Eric— my chin is bigger than my ego— Roberts (The Pope of Greenwich Village, Runaway Train, The Ambulance) puts everyone to the test as raging Reno."

Official Chung Ho convenes a conference of all existing martial arts schools and societies to attempt to devise a global plan to combat this crisis. Naturally, all these battle wizards disagree on everything and go at each other’s throats. Until, like a deus ex machina, the beautiful and deadly Flying Cloud descends from the heavens on a crane. This unworldly fighting wonder seems the right person to go and find the magical antidote to the Heavenly Dragons. This extremely rare substance can only be found in the gall bladder of a 1000-year-old turtle (yuck!). But Flying Cloud must deal with an opponent in her path, the equally beautiful and life-threatening Blue Butterfly, who has her own reasons for being unfriendly to our heroine.

This work, which sprang from the mind of the “godfather of gothic horror,” H.P. Lovecraft, has been spun into a chilling triptych starring the master himself. In “The Library,’ Lovecraft (Jeffrey Combs) succeeds in penetrating the hidden catacombs of an old library, where he discovers the Necronomicon. Opening the book leads to the awakening of “something” indescribable. In The Drowned, a young man (Bruce Payne) inherits a sinister house by the sea. He uses the secrets of the place to resurrect his dead girlfriend, bringing the old evil “Cthulhu” out of its slumber. The Cold is about the bizarre romance between a young music student and a strange, old doctor (David Warner), who carries a gruesome and deadly secret. And in Whispers, a policewoman follows the bloody trail of her kidnapped partner. It leads to an old building, which gives access to an underworld from which there is no escape.

Producer Samuel Hadida (Reservoir Dogs, Killing Zoe, True Romance) and director Brian Yuzna (Re-Animator, From Beyond) were the driving forces behind this gruesome tribute to H.P. Lovecraft. Helped by French director Christophe Gans and Japanese director Shu Kaneko, and featuring actors such as Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, Dr. Mordrid), David Warner (Tom Jones, The Omen) and Bruce Payne (Absolute Beginners, Passenger 57), and with thumbs and fingers biting off special effects by the likes of Screaming Mad George (Freddy IV, Bride of Re-Animator, Poltergeist II), the stories of this good old Clive Barker, Stephen King and so many others are given an audiovisual makeover that fans will long remember."

And with him, his armada of flying metal spheres which love nothing more than to drill holes in your head. This “undertaker” with his shockproof ticker continues to turn the world into one big funeral feast. Reggie and Mike, who have finally grown up, must do it without their friend Jody, at least without his physical presence. For Jody has been transformed into one of the flying spheres. In this rounded form, he must assist his friends in their fight against the Tall Man. For some extra-dimensional reason, he has set his sights on Mike. What follows is a feverish manhunt through abandoned morgues, ruined villages, and glass crypts, guaranteed to knock you off your feet.

Before Jason and long before Freddy, there was “The Tall Man” and his possessed metal balls. Legend has it that the character was created by writer/director Don Coscarelli (The Beastmaster, Survival Quest) after weeks of solitary isolation in a mountain cabin. He first appeared on the screen in 1979 in the first Phantasm. The film became a huge international success by being one of the first to combine black humour with shocking SFX. In 1987, he made the equally successful sequel Phantasm II. And now there is the final part in this classic trilogy. Under the expert guidance of “state of the art” special effects and maniacally wacky stunts, we find out the origin of The Tall Man and the nature of his flying spheres. Angus Scrimm, who once wrote cover notes for records by The Beatles and The Beach Boys, once again gives worthy portrayal to this icon of horror. Reggie Bannister (Silent Night, Deadly Night IV) and Michael Baldwin look tremendous as the afflicted friends Reggie and Mike."

Power-hungry soldier Mailer misuses the discovered technology to send a Stealth nuclear bomber to Germany in 1943. The consequences are obvious. The Nazis win the war and the swastika lands on American soil. Herdeg, the only man who can travel through time alive, is catapulted into the alternative America of 1993. Pursued by brown-shirts, David must find the time generator to flash back to 1943 and restore history. He can count on the help of the rebels and their leader Jess (Marjean Holden), with whom he falls in love. And that is a very sadistic move by the scriptwriter, because if David succeeds in restoring the course of history (if, if…), he will erase the alternative timeline and loose his love. What’s a man to do?

Director Stephen Cornwell (The Killing Streets), who is currently working on the contemporary adaptation of the Fritz Lang classic M, plays to his heart’s content with father time and mother alternative reality. Brad Johnson (the lovable hero from Steven Spielberg’s Always) is the time traveller. Marjean Holden (Nemesis, Silent Night, Deadly Night IV) is the rebel leader. Responsible for all the trouble David Herdeg must struggle through is screenwriter Kevin Rock (The Howling VI & VII, Warlock: The Armageddon)."

Shiny wide streets are lined with neat little houses. Small, green parks teem with playing children. Cars are clean, crime is low and the local are polite. In short, a middle-class utopia that makes your mouth water. And the prospect of a terribly tedious film if it weren’t for the arrival of Whiley Pritcher (Ron Marquette). This mysterious stranger with the piercing gaze takes up residence in the little hotel of ex-mayor Bob Hodges. Soon he puts the stick in the hornet’s nest by starting up a programme on local cable television. In “Our Town,” presenter Pritcher asks only one question: “What’s wrong with Brewster?” In the beginning, the reactions are limited to bins taken out too early and watering the lawn on Sundays, but in time, the cesspool slowly starts to boil over. The true nature of paradise emerges when everyone starts flinging each other’s dirty laundry in the face.

Behind a decent façade there is often an underground of decay, decadence, and corruption, as the works of David Lynch teach us. And 27-year-old debutant director Bryan Singer has taken this to heart. Shot in super-fast time (18 days) and super-cheaply made ($250,000), this sharp thriller not only drew enthusiastic comments from the critics, but also won the Grand Jury Prize at Robert Redford’s Sundance Film Festival. Psychopath Pritcher, brilliantly played by television actor Ron Marquette (Beauty and the Beast, 2000 Malibu Road, The Fortunate Pilgrim) is a vicious metaphor for people’s ignorance and the instant-emotion gratification techniques of modern media. Bryan Singer is an evil man with a great future."

A beginning that can count. 17 years later. Young dancer Marlee (Tracy Wells) and her autistic brother Jeffrey (Carlton Beener) move in with the religious community of Sister Marion (Lois Nettleton). The two youngsters fall under the influence of the same antique mirror which fulfils their wishes, good and bad. They are visited by Marlee’s half-sister, Roslyn (Sally Kellerman), a real schemer, and the manipulative doctor Lasky (Roddy McDowall). The duo is out to have Marlee declared insane to get their claws on a rich inheritance. The mirror, however, has other plans.

Raven Dance is the sequel to Mirror, Mirror and continues the saga about the antique mirror with life-threatening reflections. Director Jimmy Lifton, who makes his debut with this film, not only wrote the screenplay, but also composed the music. Lifton is a well-known composer of film music and has directed numerous video clips. His film stands firm with two experienced actors such as Sally Kellerman (M.A.S.H., Brewster McCloud, That’s Life) as the scheming wench and Roddy McDowall (The Twilight Zone, Planet of the Apes, Fright Night I & II) as the poisonous doctor Lasky. Tracy Wells, known for the TV series Mr. Belvedere and appearances in Gremlins and Annie, among others, dances through her first leading role, aided by blind nun Veronica Cartwright (L.A.

Unaware that she is the prime suspect in a possible murder, Linda jumps in her Corvette and checks into an expensive hotel under the name DeeDee Slaughter. There she meets Paul (C.

The trio seem to have found each other and start experimenting with all kinds of alcoholic and erotic cocktails. When Paul’s fiancée Gail suddenly shows up and catches her boyfriend in bed with Linda, the fun is over. Petulant Linda gets into a scuffle, and moments later Gail is found dead. And of course, our Scream Queen is once again the prime suspect.

This black comedy is simultaneously a parody on the erotic thriller and a satire on the Z-movies, the blood & gore chainsaw epics. Under the firm direction of ex-Brian De Palma assistant Sam Irvin, who made a name for himself with the equally black comedy “Guilty As Charged” (screened at the 10th Festival), the best of the actors is brought out with great nuance and irony. Linda Fiorentino (Afterhours, The Moderns, Vision Quest) is the horror-vamp, C.Thomas Howell (The Hitcher, Soul Man, E.T.) plays the uptight streaker and Nancy Allen (Robocop I, II & III, Dressed to Kill, Blow Out) is his wild-eyed colleague.

One of them is the Imp, an apocalyptic force of pure energy, trapped in a bottle. Tom manages to escape from the laboratory and ends up in the apocalyptic no man’s land outside the city. There, in the shadow of the unwieldy giants, lives a whole community of little creatures. Tom finds protection with Jack, the giant slayer. The latter is very interested in Tom’s stories about the Imp and sees in it the possibility of taking revenge on the giants.  

Eraserhead meets Pinocchio. This dark and funny fairy tale extends the boundaries of animated film. The Bolex Brothers studio of Dave Bortwick and Dave Riddett developed an ingenious combination of 3D animation of models with “pixilation,” filming real actors frame by frame. This technique has already produced brilliant results with Creatures, Vikings Go Pumping and Igor’s Horn. The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb, which took almost two years to make, is the Bolex brothers’ first major production. It is based on an award-winning 10-minute pilot episode (which caused quite a scandal at the BBC). The result is a stunning and shocking viewing piece, a reinterpretation of the legend of Tom Thumb in a post-industrial dream world of giants and little people. The musical theme of the film was written by Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones. The filmmakers took on most of the acting parts."

In a Poland haunted by the spectre of impending war, a novelist’s inspiration is fed by obsessive nightmares. With chilling force, they evoke human sacrifices performed in an obscure corner of another era. When a hotel detective rescues the writer from a mysterious murder attempt, the story bursts open. The assailant dissolves into the night and the case is filed without consequence. The police, the secret services of various countries and other disputed and dubious organisations then take a remarkable interest in the young woman and her private life. During all this, the sinister shadow of the imminent world fire creeps over East and West.

Far removed from the metaphysical esotericism of his fellow countrymen, director Marek Piestrak has always had a healthy interest in the great popular myths of film. The Tears of the Dark Prince is a homage to the American film noir of the 1940s. We witness a search (as in Howard Hawks’ The Big Sleep), led by a shabby detective with a floppy felt hat, that takes us to shady atmospheres, lit in shadows. You can recognise here one of the characteristics of fantasy, made in Warsaw: a psychoanalytical metaphor for historical and political realities. The scenario frighteningly describes the climate that preceded the signing of the Molotov-Von Ribbentrop pact, the diabolical alliance between Hitler and Stalin. Also, worth mentioning is the beautiful expressionist animation that adorns the generic and in which everyone will be able to find something to their liking."

That night, during one of her séances for wealthy clients, Adriana declares in a trance that someone in the room is a murderer. She rushes out into the rain, followed by Stefan. Aura runs after them, … and stumbles upon their corpses! They have fallen victim to the maniac killer who terrorizes Minneapolis by decapitating his victims with a mechanical steel wire. Devastated, the poor child seeks out David, who in a fit of love decides to help her. They discover a photograph of all the killer’s victims, taken when they were all in the same hospital many years ago. The trail leads to Aura’s psychiatrist, Dr. Judd. In a bloody confrontation in which the heads of the victims roll in all directions, the bad guy gets killed. A happy ending… Or is it? Aura has disappeared. Will David find her? And was Dr. Judd really Hannibal the Cannibal’s demented nephew?

Last year we couldn't screen it due to all sorts of problems between producers and distributors, but this year we finally got it. The Italian master of psychological horror, the man who is on direct dial with David Lynch, Tim Burton, David Cronenberg, and many others, is back at the festival. Dario Argento’s “Trauma” once again guarantees stylised manipulations of your emotions and fears via an omnipresent camera. Like “Two Evil Eyes,” this bizarre and visually brilliant murder story is set in the USA and is backed by an impressive cast. Besides Dario’s daughter Asia as the paranoid Aura, we find James Russo, Brad Dourif (as his usual crazy self), Frederick Forrest (“Apocalypse Now”) as Doctor Judd and Piper Laurie (“Carrie,” “Twin Peaks”) as Aura’s mother, Adriana."

In his search for incriminating evidence against a suspect, his wife and a rich client are murdered. Immediately, a huge scandal erupts. The client in question, Carlo Stasio, was a famous painter who, as usual, left behind a wife—Selina—and a lover—Angeline (Laura San Giacomo). Both have a great deal to gain from the death of their wealthy husband-bedfellow. Naturally, Tony gets the label “prime suspect” stuck on his head. Helped by Frank, his only friend in the police force, he has no choice but to try and clear his name. Sultry Angeline does not make it easy for Tony by effectively countering his grave suspicions against her with passionate horizontal frolics. Then there is his former colleague, who does not exactly have his best interests at heart and wants to get Tony in jail as quickly as possible.

Under Suspicion is an exciting thriller by Simon Moore. Made in the good old Hitchcock tradition, a falsely accused man faces the rest of the world alone to prove his innocence. Liam Neeson, the tragic hero from Darkman and likely to soon win an Oscar for his role as Oscar Schindler in Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List, delivers as Tony Aaron. Laura San Giacomo (Sex, Lies and Videotape), as a seemingly fragile brunette, gives him a top-notch oral and physical response."

It is rather a variation on the same theme, being the son of the devil who indulges himself in dolby stereo on us poor little people. Of course, Julian Sands (A Room With A View, Gothic, Archnaphobia) is once again to be admired as the diabolical one. To counteract him we have Paula Marshall (Hellraiser III) as Samantha, and Chris Young (Max Headroom, The Great Outdoors) as Kenny. The freeze-frame special effects come from the hyper-sophisticated computer of regular Bob Keen (Children of the Corn, Hellraiser III). The first Warlock won the Audience Prize in 1991. What will the second one get?"
1994,movie ,,,WE'RE BACK!  A DINOSAUR'S STORY,"Dick Zondag, Ralph Zondag, Phil Nibbelink, Simon Wells",1993,USA,,,"John Goodman, Charles Fleischer, Blaze Berdahl",,,,,,,72',"Animation, Adventure, Comedy",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0108526,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0",,,,,"For a few hundred million years, dinosaurs have been strolling across the Earth’s crust, unaware of the equally mastodon-like hype in the distant future. They are visited by the friendly Captain NewEyes in his time-ship. He feeds the beasts his special Brain-Boosting Muesli, whereupon the IQs of Rex, the tender tyrannosaur, Elsa, the flying Pterodactyl, Dweed, the peeled Hadrosaurus and Woog, the good-humoured Triceratops skyrocket. NewEyes suggests they follow him to the future, where millions of children are eager to meet them. They end up in New York, where they soon make friends with Louie, a street urchin, and Cecilia, a lonely rich kid. Our thunderous dinosaurs triumph on Broadway, which attracts the attention of Professor Screweyes, Captain NewEyes’ sneaky brother. He is willing to do “anything” to get the philosophical giants into his Eccentric Circus. Will Louie and Cecilia be able to save their new friends?

Following the success of Fievel Goes West, We’re Back is the second animated film from Amblin Entertainment, which was founded by Steven Spielberg after the success of Don Bluth’s The Land Before Time. Together with the duo Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall (Alive, Arachnophobia, Raiders of the Lost Ark), he signed on for the production. Screenwriter John Patrick Shanley (Moonstruck) adapted Hudson Talbott’s beloved children’s book for the screen. The voices are those of Walter Croncite (the legendary face of American television news) as Captain NewEyes, John Goodman (Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, King Ralph) as Rex, TV-host Jay Leno, Rhea Pearlman (Carla from Cheers) and many others. The music was composed by James Horner (Aliens, The Name of the Rose, Cocoon), who received an Oscar for An American Tail."
1994,movie ,,,WRONG MAN,Jim McBride,1993,USA,,,"Rosanna Arquette, Kevin Anderson, John Lithgow",,,,,,,104',"Romance, Thriller",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0108597,?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_10",,,,,"Alex Walker (Kevin Anderson), a sailor accused of murder, flees the authorities to the shabby town of Tampico, Mexico. He meets an American smuggler, who runs off with his money. An enraged Walker locates the miscreant’s flat, but when he raids it, he finds the man dead. Naturally, he is the prime suspect for the Mexican police. With the ground once again getting too hot for him, Walker seeks refuge in the backseat of a big, red Chevrolet. This classy car is owned by Phillip Mills (John Lithgow), a somewhat shady businessman, and his sexy wife Missy (Rosanna Arquette). The trio seem to get along well and decide to take the Chevy for a trip from Tampico to Guatemala. Soon, a steamy, erotic love triangle develops. Alex falls in love with Missy, who sees in the handsome sailor a ticket to a new life away from her domineering husband. Tension, conflict, lust, murder, and everything goes on the Mexican highway.

After more than 10 years of struggling with the script, producer Alan Beattie finally found the cash and a director to turn The Wrong Man into pictures. Jim McBride, who had already made a name for himself with Breathless, a remake of Jean-Luc Godard’s À Bout de Souffle and the brooding The Big Easy, made one of those films that is hard to fail. A clever script, a tight budget and an enthusiastic cast led to an exciting, sultry psychological thriller. Rosanna Arquette (Baby, it’s You, Desperately Seeking Susan, Silverado) succeeds in getting rid of her somewhat bitchy image. John Lithgow (Raising Cain) is “the man on the run” and Kevin Anderson plays the role of the bad husband. The beautiful music is by none other than Los Lobos."
1994,movie ,"The Night, 12th Fantastic Night",,ROBOCOP 3,Fred Dekker,1993,USA,,,"Robert John Burke, Nancy Allen, Mario Machado",,,,,,,104',"Action, Crime, Science-Fiction",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0107978,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0",,,,,"In the near future, big-city warfare has been perfected to perfection. The few families left living in inner-city Detroit are being ambushed by gangs of Splatterpunks and hunted down by armoured security forces for “rehabilitation.” Behind this “urban cleansing” are our friends from OCP, the perfidious multinational. They want to bulldoze the last city neighbourhoods to finally start building their super-metropolis: Delta City. The only hitch is their most successful product: Robocop (Robert Burke). As Robo witnesses the spectacle of helpless families fleeing, a small war begins between his programmed policies and his last shreds of humanity. A rebel group, led by tough Bertha (C.C.H. Pounder), and especially the computer prodigy Nikko, prevail. Robocop takes flight (literally!) and rebels against his bosses. In his way stands the feared ninja Otomo (Bruce Locke), the brand-new law enforcement model ED 209, and some sloppy billions of dollars from multinational OCP.

Director Fred Dekker (The Monster Squad: Special Prize in 87, Night of the Creeps) and screenwriter/comic book artist Frank Miller (Elektra, The Dark Knight Returns) take revenge on the failed Robocop II. Number 3 is a return to the humour, satire, and cynical edge that made the first Robocop such a success. Robert Burke (Simple Men, Ramblin’ Rose, Dust Devil) takes over the armour of Peter Weller as the new Robo. Nancy Allen (Dressed to Kill, Poltergeist II, Roses are Dead) is still his colleague, police officer Anne Lewis. And Bruce Locke (Black Rain) plays the role of Otomo, Robo’s ninja nemesis. Special effects wizard Phil Tippett, who created the Imperial Walkers in “The Empire Strikes Back,” is the man who makes Robocop fly like a 75% recyclable Superman."
1994,movie ,"The Night, 12th Fantastic Night",,TAKING THE HEAT,Tom Mankiewicz,1993,USA,,,"Tony Goldwyn, Lynn Whitfield, George Segal",,,,,,,91',"Action, Comedy, Thriller",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0108284,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0",,,,,"Michaell Norell (Tony Goldwyn) is an arrogant businessman who makes his living out of the misery of struggling companies. One day he witnesses a mafia murder, committed by Tommy Canard (Alan Arkin). Norell, not wanting to miss his skiing holiday, lies to police sergeant Carolyn Hunter (Lynn Whitfield) and packs his bags. Six months later, prosecutor Leon Kepler (George Segal) finds evidence that Norell was present at the murder. The same Sergeant Hunter is given the thankless task of bringing the very unwilling Norell in for questioning. And the clashing antagonism between the irritating yuppie and the poorly paid policewoman heats up even more because of the temperature, the highest ever in New York. What’s more, the duo is being chased by a gang of killers sent by Canard. Norell and Hunter flee for their lives through the sweaty, crumbling metropolitan jungle. Meanwhile, in the courtroom, the judge (Peter Boyle) is eager to release Canard, who quietly, over his mobile, leads the manhunt for the key witness.

Writer/director Tom Mankiewicz is one of the most respected American screenwriters. He established his reputation as a (co-) screenwriter for numerous James Bond films, The Deep, Superman and Ladyhawke, among others. His film debut was the funny Dragnet, with Tom Hanks and Dan Aykroyd. In Taking the Heat, we get to see a comic thriller cocktail of metropolitan chaos, heat, mafia, cops, and yuppies. Lynn Whitfield (The Josephine Baker Story, Silverado, Hill Street Blues) plays the gritty policewoman. Tony Goldwyn already played the depraved businessman in Ghost. Veteran Alan Arkin (Catch 22, Edward Scissorhands, Glengarry Glenn Ross) plays the bad guy with pleasure. George Seagal (Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, The Bridge at Remagen, Look who’s talking) may be the good judge, and Peter Boyle (The Candidate, Young Frankenstein, Taxi Driver) the bad."
1994,movie ,"The Night, 12th Fantastic Night",,MANIAC COP 3: BADGE OF SILENCE,William Lustig,1992,USA,,,"Robert Davi, Robert Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany",,,,,,,85',"Action, Horror",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0104808,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0",,,,,"Junkies in distress raid a pharmacy. Policewoman Kate Sullivan manages to take out one of the robbers before she herself suffers a stroke and falls into a coma. A freelance TV crew films the incident and, out of sensationalism, manipulates the footage so that it appears that Kate shot an innocent person. “Police brutality,” screams the crowd, whereupon the commissioner and the hospital think it would be better if Kate did not wake up. Courageous Doctor Susan Fowler prevents this, and Detective Sean McKinney, whom we remember from Maniac Cop II, sets out to prove his colleague’s innocence. For this he gets help from an unexpected corner. Maniac Cop Matt Cordell, once a victim of foul play too - which landed him a conviction for eternally handing out bloody parking tickets - goes through this with his crude bat to change everyone’s mind about Kate. But he doesn’t just have cruel good intentions. In Kate, an old friend from the police academy, he sees an ideal woman to share his eternally doomed patrolling. “Wife of Maniac Cop: A Partnership Made in Hell???” Who knows, who knows.

The second resurrection of Matt Cordell was something that, given the success of the previous two episodes, just had to happen. Action Master William Lustig (Maniac, Hit List, Maniac Cop I & II) and screenwriter and fellow (iconic) director Larry Cohen (It’s Alive, God Told Me So, The Ambulance), who came up with the character, made this the best of the three. Spectacular car chases, innovative stunts, humorous dialogue, and raw police brutality all in one benefit package. Robert Davi (Raw Deal, Die Hard, The Goonies) is still Detective McKinney and Robert Z’Dar (Beastmaster II) is the maniac cop for the third time."

culture, François Bourgeon builds his stories and
his images with the patience and the meticulousness
of the most perfect of all the Irish miniaturist monks.
The effect is all the more striking when he uses and
applies this virtue, this technique and this thematic
in a large sciencefiction fresco.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1994,event,"Hommage, Hommage to Vincent Price ",,Hommage to Vincent Price ,,,,,"In 1973 Raoul Ruiz exchanges Chile for Paris, where his style suddenly turns towards fantasy. His films follow labyrinthine plot lines and inventively display a powerful feeling of displacement. For the viewer this results in feelings of disorientation, enhanced by Ruiz’s generous images and favoured by intelligent editing. Cinema Nova presents a small selection from the vast body of work that Ruiz has produced over the years : the enigmatic thriller The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting (1978), The Territory (1981, co-produced by Roger Corman ), Treasure Island (1985) and Fado majeur et mineur (1993).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
