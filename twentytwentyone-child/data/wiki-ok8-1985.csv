Before he started his career in film as stuntman and extra he had already practiced many occupations.
He actually started his career on TV but quickly got hired by «Hammer» for a series of horror films like «The curse of the Werewolf», and «The two faces of Doktor Jekyll».
From 1971 on, he became one of the most prominent stars in British film. He was very convincing in «The three Musketeers» as Athos, unexpected as Bismark in «Royal Flash» but above all delivered a remarkable performance as Urbain Grandier in «The Devils».
He may be the only one to withstand the comparison between the early «Monsters» of the Fantastic film (Lee, Price, enz...) because when his massive figure, strong, insensitive to pain or fear, fills the screen, the spectator is overcome by fear.

1985,guest,Guests of Honour,,,"Christopher, Tucker",,USA,,"With the rise of “Hammer” and the new fantastic films, the focus of the public turned to a man who works in the shadows: the make-up artist.
Certainly, the mood and atmosphere typical for the golden age of Hammer, loses more territory to a radically opposite composition in horror and fantastic film: the introduction of explicit violence and blood effects. And while the fantastic and science fiction film grew on the people, the make-up artists became real stars, a fact which is easy to understand. Without them this type of films would never have increased in popularity.

Chris Tucker was an opera singer before he became one of the greatest among make-up artists. He had a peculiar hobby: during his free time he made noses, big as those of Cyrano, tiny, long, flat, hundreds which, on a beautiful day he had to sell out of necessity. This became his big shot because he was offered a make-up artist job for television. Ever since, he has achieved a phenomenal perfection and diversity, with ageing (The Hunger) being his specialty. Without taking his television work into account, the films “Elephant Man” and “Quest for Fire” brought him in the spotlight as a creator of monsters which surprisingly come across friendly.
Tucker also proved his talent on “Star Wars”, “The third man”, “Dune”, “The Meaning of Life” and “The Company of Wolves”.",,,,,,,,,,Make-Up Department,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,name,nm0875823,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3",,,,,

During this period he worked with many well-known directors such as: Michael Powell, John Huston, Jak Cardiff, Joseph Losey en Jack Clayton (The Innocents). Alongside Jack Cardiff he received an Oscar for photography in 1960 with «Sons and Lovers».

In 1961 he directed «Two and two make six» and joined the renewal of British film, under supervision of «Hammer».

The contribution of Freddie Francis to that period is characterized by a return to traditions from the golden time of film (James Whale en Rowland Lee).

After more than 10 years of inactivity he returns to the spotlight with his photography in films like «Elephant Man», «The French Lieutenant’s Women» and more recent «Dune».

1985,event,"Retrospective, British Directors & Actors",,British Directors & Actors,,,,,"But where did the English fantastic film go?
Wasn’t it till recently a synonym for horror and the supernatural?
We think about the production organizations like Hammer and Amicus, important directors like Terence Fisher, Freddie Francis, Val Guest, Hitchcock, Don Sharp, John Gilling, Roy Ward Baker, Jack Clayton, James Whale,… (and then famous actors like Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee,... )
After an American period (1920-40), the English fantastic film retook its prominent place in (1950-1970). And it was only fair. Because eventually the fantastic imagination is rooted in England with Stevenson (Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde), Shelley (Frankenstein), Caroll (Alice in wonderland) or H.G. Wells (Brave new world,... ).
And now in 1985 we present thirty public screenings and amongst them is only one English Film (The house of the Long Shadows)... WHAT HAPPENED?
While the last film of Terence Fisher (Frankenstein and the monster from Hell, 1973) was poor reviews by the public, the «Exorcist» by Friedkin (1973) returned to the spotlights of fantastic film. 
It knew a tremendous success and today it represents 50% of the global business number in film industry. 
The exorcist obviously illustrated the fondness of the public for shocking images but killed the English «gothic» film at the same time. The renaissance of fantastic film meant the demise of English fantastic film.
No more chiaroscuro, over with the dark, mythical characters, with obsessed scientists and baroque setting.
There is room now for a more emotional explicit cinema that no longer has room for the supernatural. 
It’s a fact that the English fantastic film had disappeared. But does that mean the English gave up for good? We must be aware that their genius creativity is still present in fantastic and science fiction film. And if the United States is quantitatively stronger then the quality and diversity are still English.
First of all there is an old group, who without adapting themselves, still use old formulas in a humorous manner (Roy Ward Baker, with «Monster Club») or sufficiently use new technologies (Jack Clayton with «Something wicked this way comes»).
Second there are those who don’t want to wear the label of fantastic and science fiction film directors but are still the greatest representatives: Ken Russell (Altered States, The Devils), John Boorman (Zardoz, Excalibur), Lindsay Anderson (O Lucky Man, Britania Hospital).
Thirdly there are the directors from English descent but who work abroad: Michael Anderson (Dominique, Orca, Logan 's run), Michael Hodges (Flash Gordon, Moron's from outer spaces), Gordon Hessler (The oblong Box, Scream and scream again),...
Then there are the actors who got famous doing fantastic and science fiction films: John Hurt (Elephant Man, 1984), Sting (Dune), or Oliver Reed (The Devils, The Brood, Burnt Offerings,. .. ) who without a doubt is the only one worthy of the title «Horror moviestar» and can bear the comparison with predecessors like Cushing, Lee, enz...
Following all the others: Donald Pleasance (N-Y 1997, Halloween, etc...), Julie Christie (Desmond seed, Memoirs of a survivor, Don 't look now), Robert Powell (The survivor, Harlequin), Terence Stamp (Superman, Company of wolves), Tim Curry (The Rocky Horror Pictures Show, Legend).
And last but not least there is the young generation of directors in whom we put our trust: especially Ridley Scott who with «Alien» and «Blade Runner» made the most exceptional films in years. And also his brother, Tony Scott (The Hunger), Harry Davenport (X-Tro), Neil Jordan (The company of wolves), Michael Radford (1984)...
Maybe they represent the beginning of rehabilitation for English fantastic and science fiction film. 
Our retrospective has chosen a few films that date back to the golden age. They demonstrate that the English fantastic and science fiction film have adequately adapted to the evolution of the seventies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Born in Elsene in 1944. Studied Fine Arts in Brussels. Worked with Roger Somville and Jo Henrion. Studied bronze casting at the foundry of Pietra-Santa in Italy.
«His challenge is to sculpt in small form, part by part, rocks, complete trees in bronze, characters in silver, miniature trees (Bonsai) behold the small world of the artist.
Paul Delvaux considered his work a discovery of a new art form. The marble models, his metal constructions of rocks and the towers of Babel are formed, piece-by-piece, in silence. A mirror reflects a woman… 5 centimetres high. And yet what a dimension, sometimes monumental art has puzzling aspects.»
