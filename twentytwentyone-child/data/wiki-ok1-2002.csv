Will Patton, Debra Messing, Alan Bates",,,,,,,119',"Drama, Horror, Mystery",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0265349,",,,,,"John Klein is a successful journalist and is happily
married to the beautiful Mary. While driving
back
from looking at the dream house they want to buy,
Mary sees something fly at the windshield and she
crashes the car. John didn’t see anything, but the
thing continues to haunt Mary. Soon after the incident,
she dies from an inexplicable brain tumour.
Two years later, John still grieves for his wife. When
driving to an assignment, his car suddenly breaks
down on a lonely road. He discovers that somehow
he’s driven to the small town of Point Pleasant, 400
miles off his main course, with no idea how he got
there. After becoming intrigued by reports of unexplained
phenomena and sightings of a “winged
being”, John decides to stay for a while. The reports
seem to be connected not only to each other, but
also to the strange drawings Mary did before she
died.
Mark Pellington, who visited us in 1999 with his topnotch
thriller debut Arlington Road, has based his
second film on some bizarre, allegedly true events that
occurred in the mid-60s in Point Pleasant, West Viriginia.
The film draws its power from the fundamentally
chilling story and Pellington’s assured direction. The
Mothman Prophecies, with its wonderfully self-reflective
structure and haunting ending will continue to
engage the audience long after the end credits. With in
the leading parts Richard Gere (Internal Affairs, Red
Corner, The Jackal), Laura Linney (TV’s Tales of the City,
The Truman Show) and Alan Bates (The Fixer, Gosford
Park)."
2002,movie,Closing,,ROLLERBALL by John McTiernan,John McTiernan,2002,"USA, Ireland",,,"Jean Reno,
Rebecca Romijn-Stamos,
L.L. Cool J., Pink, Chris Klein,
Naveen Andrews",,,,,,,98',"Action, Science-Fiction, Sport",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0246894,",,,,,"Jonathan Cross is an all-A merican hotshot, the
most popular player in the fastest and most
extreme sport of all time : Rollerball, a combination
of rugby, roller derby, hockey and motorcycle racing.
Along with team-mates Marcus Ridley and Aurora,
Jonathan is living the high life; fame, money, incredible
cars, all for giving viewers what they want : a
dangerous game packed with visceral thrills, breakneck
speed and head-slamming action. Things go
wrong when Rollerball’s creator, Petrovich, realizes
that serious on-court accidents bring higher viewer
ratings. Soon Jonathan and his friends are playing for
their lives. The team-mates find themselves trapped
in intrigue; pawns in a new game without any rules.
Rollerball is an exciting remake by acclaimed action
director John McTiernan (Predator, Die Hard, The
Hunt for Red October) of Norman Jewison’s 1975
classic Rollerball, starring James Caan as Jonathan.
While the original movie took place in the future,
McTiernan’s version looks like it could happen next
year. The success of reality tv-shows like Survivor,
that show ordinary people behaving like savages
when placed in extreme circumstances, makes this
premise frighteningly plausible indeed. Chris Klein
(Election, American Pie) incarnates all-A merican hero
Jonathan. His team-mates Marcus and Aurora are
parts by LL Cool J (Halloween H20, Deep Blue Sea)
and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (X-M en). Jean Reno
(Léon, Mission Impossible, Ronin) is the villainous
Petrovich. With a screenplay by Larry Ferguson (The
Hunt for Red October) and John Pogue (The Skulls)
and special effects by John Sullivan (Eraser, The 13th
Warrior)."

young inspector, arrives from Rome to investigate
the murders. She soon realizes that the only person
who can help her is Simone, who can recognize the
killer by the only characteristic he cannot change :
his voice.
Almost Blue, the long feature debut of Italian director
Alex Infascelli is an exciting thriller with a breathtaking
ending. He started his career in 1990 as an
assistant director on video clips for Kiss, Nirvana and
Prince and has realized many clips for artists like The
Cocteau Twins. In 1995, Infascelli was one of 10
young Italian talents behind the compilation film
DeGenerazione. The year after, he collaborated with
13 other directors on “Exercises de style”, a sketch
film inspired by the works of Raymond Queneau. For
Almost Blue, he could count on the performances of
Lorenza Indovina (La Scorta, La Tregua) as Grazia,
Claudio Santamaria (La Stanza del Figlio) as Simone
a n d R o l a n d o
Ravello (La Cena) as the killer."

thrill of killing and is driven to become the number
one assassin. The only challenge in his way is O. Tok
tries to force his rival out of seclusion by approaching
his secret crush Chin. She’s O’s part-time housekeeper.
For a long time Chin has suspected O to be a
professional hit man. Her theory is confirmed when
she meets Tok, but before she knows it, Chin has
become a part of this dangerous world. Interpol
agent Lee has been investigating O for years. Just
when he’s close to cracking the case, O vanishes with
Chin after a violent shootout. Lee has a hard time of
letting go of the case. He knows Tok wants to challenge
O into a duel. So how can he get the two of
them together?
In the past decade, Hong Kong action movie directors
like John Woo, Ringo Lam and Tsui Hark have
become household names. To this list you can now
add Johnnie To (The Mission, Running out of Time).
Together with his long-time collaborator, screenwriter
Wai Ka Fai, he has directed the daring, genreblending
thriller Full Time Killer. Adapted from a best
selling book by the same name, the movie mixes
elegant bullet-ballet action with solid performances;
in particular Hong Kong stars Andy Lau (Boat People,
Days of Being Wild) as the ambitious killer Tok and
Simon Yam (Bullet in the Head, The Mission) as
inspector Lee."

glitterazi are saying, on the streets, in the clubs, in
the business. His agent, his best mate and his girlfriend
all know it. Come Monday, Billy will be up
there with the big boys. But the hip squad turns out
to be wrong. Monday brings disaster. Billy’s anticipated
triumphant debut flops. His world falls apart.
His self-esteem splinters. As Billy desperately tries to
rationalise his failure, the abyss of obscurity looms
before him. Suddenly, he’s on a roller coaster ride
into the London underworld, a dangerous land of
murderers, thieves and talent agents.
The Last Minute is a darkly comic tale of fame, delusion
and the high price of failure, written and
directed by Stephen Norrington (Death Machine,
Blade). The film features a cutting-edge soundtrack
boasting Leftfield and Aphex Twin, surprising special
effects by Neil Gorton and Steve Painter (From Hell,
Judge Dredd) and wide screen cinemascope photography
by James Welland (Divorcing Jack, Beautiful

family is gunned down in the streets, gangster
boss Sandeman and his three daughters are thrown
into a nasty game of greed and betrayal. Struck by
grief and determined to learn the truth about his
wife’s shocking death, Sandeman decides to turn his
illegal empire over to his three daughters. However,
Jo, the youngest and Sandeman’s favourite, has
already turned her back on the family. In a fit of rage,
Sandeman disowns her and divides the business
between his other two daughters. With their newfound
power, the eldest daughter Kath and her
young sister Tracy engage in a vicious power struggle
at the expense of everyone and everything
around them. A powerless Sandeman watches his
world implode. With only his young grandson by his
side, Sandeman sets out to even the score, whatever
the cost.
In My Kingdom, director Don Boyd (Kleptomania,
Twenty-One) uses Shakespeare’s King Lear as the
framework for his compelling tale about the downfall
of a powerful gangster. It deals with our obsession
about the criminal underworld. We know it
deals in misery, sexual degradation, drug-addiction
and violent death, but that doesn’t stop us wan
ting to know every gory detail about the lifestyle of
the rich and infamous. With a stellar cast led by Richard
Harris (A Man Called Horse, Unforgiven, Gladiator)

Lightfoot collided with an alien spacecraft that discharged
biological material over the whole island

Twelve-year old newcomer Carlos is met with hostility

Guillermo del Toro, the Mexican director of the
inventive and unsettling horror films Cronos (1992)
and Mimic (1997), has realised a deeply personal
gothic horror story. More than a mournful poltergeist

Civil War that, according to Del Toro, still lingers
unresolved like a ghost. Veterans actors Marisa Paredes
(Life is Beautiful, All About My Mother) as Carmen

Casares hold the screen mainly by personal presence.
There’s also rising young star Eduardo Noriega

succeeds in maintaining the eerie and unnerving

an old insane asylum. Gordon Fleming is desperately
in need of cash after the birth of his first baby.
His crew chief, Phil, is a straight shooter, with an air of
scheming and menace. His animosity is directed
mainly at mouthy co-worker Hank who stole his
girlfriend. The thoughtful Mike is a failed law student
who finds that manual labour suits his underachieving
lifestyle. Rounding out the team is Gordon’s
nephew, Jeff, the innocent newcomer in the band of
veteran labourers. Foreboding sets in, the moment
the team starts exploring the dilapidated labyrinth,
whose winding tunnels and passages are dark and
crawling with signs of the anguished souls who once
lived there. Built at the end of the civil war, the asylum
has witnessed numerous horrifying medical
experiments. As the days pass, the building slowly
starts to release its secrets and the sanity of the team
rapidly starts to break down.
Session 9, directed by Brad Anderson (Next Stop
Wonderland, Happy Accidents) is yet another example
that a fright film need not be awash in blood and
elaborate special effects to be scary. The movie is
deliberately slow-paced, unwrapping itself frame
after frame, giving away very little with each step
and each sound, until its final scenes offer up a world
of revelations. Anderson firmly relies on the principle
that the things you don’t see are more frightening
than the things you do see. Heading the cast are
David Caruso (Kiss of Death, Proof of Life) as the
scheming Phil and Peter Mullan (Braveheart, The
Claim) as the troubled Gordon."

By the end, the Beast of Gevaudan had killed over 100 people, to this day, no one is entirely sure what it was, wolf? hyena? or something supernatural? Whatever it was, shepherds had the same life-expectancy as the red-suited guys in 'Star Trek'. The Beast is a popular myth in France, albeit one rooted firmly in reality; somewhat surprisingly it is little known to the outside world, and perhaps incredibly it has never been made into a movie. Until now... Based on the true story of the Beast of the Gevaudan that terrorized France in the mid-XVIIIth century, the movie aims to tell first and explain afterwards. In the first part, a special envoy of the King of France, altogether biologist, explorer and philosopher, arrives in the Gevaudan region, in the mountainous central part of France. The Beast has been attacking women and children for months and nobody has quite been able to harm it or even take a good look at it.

opted for a subjective camera, meaning that the

teeth are enormous, attract attention and are
impossible to hide. He has recently separated from
his first wife and is now living with his new love,
Maria. But Antonio thinks she’s having an affair with
her dentist. During an argument Maria throws an
ashtray at him, breaking his front teeth. Antonio
searches for a dentist to fix them, but what he also
discovers is that his gums hide something strange.
As he runs his tongue over the empty sockets,
memories, ghosts, slivers of the past suddenly flash
into his consciousness. With the painkillers he takes
and his increasingly paranoid state of mind, Antonio
descends into an inner torment where past, present,
reality and obsessions merge together. To further
complicate matters, his young daughter by his first
marriage is also deve-loping rather prominent teeth.
Denti, by Italian director Gabriele Salvatore (Mediterraneo,
Nirvana) is a surreal, wickedly funny black
comedy. Teeth symbolize pain and a trip to the dentist
is something we hope to avoid except when
absolutely necessary. Salvatores confronts our fears
head on, delivering a subtle, comic study of a man
whose teeth are more than just… teeth. The movie
features a stunning music track, from Gregorian
chants to techno rock, underlining the otherworldliness
of Antonio’s odd journey, marvellously played by
Sergio Rubini (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Tv’s The Count
of Monte Christo). At times a surreal blend of Freud
and horror-film conventions, at others an Oedipal
drama set against a tortured love affair, Denti is truly
one of the most unusual and visually arresting Italian
films in recent years."

stories unfold, revealing a world of lonely
souls. While the days are lazy, spent lounging in
underpants and bikini’s, the nights are steeped in
alcohol, sex and song, unleashing a fury of violence
and raw emotions. With no respite from the oppressive
heat, tension builds and tempers rise to an
atmosphere of seething aggression. This is life at its
most vulnerable and intimate; it’s the horror and
beauty of being human.
Austrian director Ulrich Seidl gained international
acclaim with award-winning documentaries such as
Good News, Animal Love and Models. His distinct
way of portraying humanity in its most isolated and
intimate moments has provoked debates about the
method of creating authenticity. Werner Herzog
ranks him among his ten favourite filmmakers. With
Dog Days, Seidl has made his first fiction film. It looks
like a realistic film with a real script, real stories and
real actors. But there are many things that are different.
Seidl worked with a script without any written
dialogue, with non-professional actors and followed
a documentary wor-king method. It was shot in the
sweltering heat of three summers in a row, from
1998 till 2000."

series of flashbacks, Fenton recounts how he and his
brother grew up in a very loving family, raised by
their widowed father. All that changed the day his
father awoke, believing he had been visited by an
angel and given a mission to destroy “demons”;
seemingly normal-looking people who walk this
earth as pure evil. Fenton’s father, and then his
brother Adam, swore to carry out this “divine” mission.
Fenton refused to participate in the killings and
tried to persuade his brother to do the same, but it is
obvious to him that they have “snapped”. Until now,
he refused to go to the police out of loyalty. The FBI

around and Nature itself seems intent on
unearthing the corpses with storms, rain, earthquakes
and landslides.
Based on the Korean black comedy The Quiet Family
(Festival 1999), this extraordinary genre-blending
remake could rightly be called Takashi Miike’s horror
musical. The director of the Dead or Alive trilogy, The
Audition and Ichi The Killer mixes slapstick, animation,
musical, horror and dark humour with abandon.
As in a musical, the characters suddenly burst
into song and dance as the mood takes them. The
climax features a bizarre homage to “Singing in the
Rain”, where even the corpses get up from their
grave to join in the muddy choreography."

“healthy” relationship, Sam begins muttering about
being a time traveller from the year 2470. With the

too late, she’s already in love. With little time to spare,
the two must discover if love can change their destiny.
Happy Accidents, by acclaimed independent director-

science fiction sub-genre of time travel. Inspired by
Thomas Vinterberg’s Festen and the way of wor-king
of Dogma 95, Anderson wanted to infuse his romantic
comedy with spontaneous naturalism. He portrays
a contemporary New York city where past and
future experiences of trust, commitment and denial
are cleverly put to the test. Marisa Tomei (My Cousin
Vinny, The Perez Family, What Women Want) is looking
for love as Ruby Weaver. Vincent D’Onofrio (Men

Wrong or Mr Wright as Sam Deed. With music by

Rapidly, his suspicions become horribly concrete, as

Every night, he tries in vain to convince the family of

Recently, the family has become an important subject
in Japanese genre cinema. Films like Visitor Q,
Kakashi or Seance portray this sacred cow of Japanese
society as a source of conflict, chaos and frequently
infernal violence. With its terrifying, spectral
grandmother and a family of crazy psychotics, A

also pays homage to horror classics like The Texas

New Zealand director Harry’s Sinclair’s second film is
quite different from his awarded debut Topless

a nice summary of what he was capable of: wild,
impulsive stories, infused with excessive, shocking onscreen

Japan that is firmly trapped between tradition and
modernity. His output is simply amazing. He shoots four
to five films each year, joining a working method
derived from experimental cinema with the appeal of
the commercial circuit. His movies, among which The
Dead or Alive trilogy, The Audition, Visitor Q and The
City of Lost Souls have won him acclaim and controversy

more than 150 feature films under his belt that span
diverse genres, making him Spain’s most outrageous and
prolific filmmaker. His inimitable and instantly recognizable
style, with trademark whooshing zooms and pans,
is at once dreamy, sensual and oddly abstract. Watching
his better films, it comes as no surprise that Orson Welles
used Franco as his assistant on the classic Falstaff. He
refused an offer to go to Hollywood and chose instead to
go his own way. The result is a back-catalogue that ranges
from magnificent movies to absolute garbage. His wandering
camera puts you right inside his head as he
explores his dream-world of night-clubs, monsters, violence

20 candles.
There’s a certain pressure on us to
brag, as we are perceived as cultural
trench-fighting veterans. People want
saucy anecdotes and other (fantastic)
stories of our heroic deeds.
Meanwhile, what about the genre?
Obviously, it sets us on fire.
More and more often, you’ll find us
staring into infinity, reminiscing about
festivals past and shedding a tear
when suddenly remembering some
fond and long gone mementos. Things
sometimes seems so far away, yet
they’re so close at the same time.
A whirlpool of memories, a multitude
of images, a cascade of numbers, a
waterfall of fantasies, hallucinations of
realities, a tornado of faces, …
20 years of obstinacy,
20 years of audacity,
20 years of exhaustion and rebirth,
20 years of friendship.
20 years to change a pumpkin into a
carriage,
Thanks to the audience who have
always supported us and still do,
Thanks to you,
The BIFFF has raised itself to the top of
cinematographic actuality, including
all the expressive forms, shapes and
sizes of Fantasy and breaching the
twilight zone of parallel cinema
universes.

this Festival hasn’t changed,
it’s still passion that drives us !

Fantasy Brussels
As usual, Brussels will lose a lot of sleep in March. The students
of the Brussels’ film schools, Rits and Narafi, will
invade the city for a quest leading them to the most spectacular
and unusual but always fantastic places. They have
exactly 12 days to realize a short film from A to Z. The
results – the short films – will be screened on Friday, the
29th of March at the Auditorium of the Passage 44.
This year, we have the honour to welcome Jack Cardiff
who will supervise the 7th Workshop.
Jack Cardiff is a man whose life and career have been inextricably
interwoven with the history of cinema spanning
eight of moving picture’s ten decades. In 1994, almost fifty
years since becoming the first British cinematographer to
win an Oscar (for Best Colour Cinematography) for his
stunning Technicolor photography on Black Narcissus,
Jack received the American Society Of Cinematographer’s
International Award.
Jack was given the scope to reach new heights in cinematic
achievement as the director of photography, firstly on A
Matter of Life and Death (Stairway To Heaven in the USA),
followed by the multi-Oscar winning films Black Narcissus,
and The Red Shoes.
Jack Cardiff’s innovative tendencies and his instinct to use
film for artistic expression have made him push the medium
in terms of its content and technical boundaries.
Innovations in film formats designed to combat the erosion
of cinema audiences by television enabled Jack to
photograph epic films on Technicolor - The Red Shoes,
Cinemascope - Fanny, Vista Vision - War and Peace, and
more recently a film on the Showscan format.
He received several other awards, such as :
“The American Society of Cinematographer’s International
Award” and “The Lifetime Achievement Award” from the
British Society of Cinematographers (’94). Other Awards
and nominations : 3 nominations for the Oscars (’57, ’61,
’62); 1 nomination for the British Academy Awards, 2
British Society of Cinematographers’ Awards (’56 en ’94);
2 Golden Globes (’48 en ’61) among many others.
It became a tradition : the BIFFF offers, with the assistance of
U.I.P., a practical course of digital special effects. To encourage
the students even more, U.I.P. gives a special prize to the
most motivated and talented student. The winner will
attend the Short Course Unit at the prestigious National Film
+ Television School in London.
We introduce a brand new prize : the James B. Harris Prize
goes to a student who has attracted attention by his or
her talent or unyielding motivation. This lucky student will
attend the “Directing Actors” course at the same famous
N.F.T.S. in London.

Métarythmes de l'Air (B) accompanies Tod Browning's
""Dracula"" (USA) 1931
Bram Stoker’s classic
story of the
world’s most
famous vampire
became an overwhelming
source
of inspiration for
many filmmakers.
Tod Brownings’
original film
remains the most

though.

architecture of
Count Dracula’s
castle dominates
the Carpathian
Mountains.
After haunting
Transylvania for ages, he decides to give the Londoners a
treat …
Bela Lugosi plays an unforgettable and horrifying Dracula..
Several modern composers wrote music for classic films of
the silent era. It is quite different to put a new soundtrack
to a sound-film. Instead of the natural soundscape and
Tsjaikovski's Lake of Swans, used for the soundtrack of the
original Browning film, Christiaan Leroy created a brand
new soundtrack in collaboration with Les Metarythmes de
l’Air.

eclectic but coherent mix of 15 more hybrid and
radical first screenings, several events and a exceptional
retrospective. Under the banner “tranS

into a laboratory of bad taste and euro babes. Each
day at 22h30, we present a seldom seen film in
retrospective. In the 1960s and 1970s, European
filmmakers took the lead in beautiful and haunting
hybrids of sex and horror. The aim of this special
program is to exemplify, on the basis of 17 films,
the sleazy, gory, sexy, blasphemous underbelly of
European cinema, an often suppressed area of
artistic endeavour distinguished by some visually
stunning films by the likes of such genre jugglers

1. The Nexus Awards
For the second time, the BIFFF will bestow the 2 NEXUS Awards
to the Best Fantasy Game for Game Consoles and the Best
Fantasy Game for PC. These prizes will distinguish two video
games, linked to the fantasy genre, for its artistic qualities or for
the aesthetical improvement at any level (graphics, script, structure).
Renowned journalists, who are specialised in games and
other cyberities, made the selection of the finalists.
The same jury will chose the winner of each category amongst
the above-mentioned finalists. The award-giving ceremony will
be held at the Halles de Schaerbeek, Sunday the 17th of March
at 19:00 hrs.
The Nexus is an artwork by H.R. Giger (Oscar for the SFX for
“Alien”).
2. The Bif3-LAN
A LAN-party ? Huh ?? Who the hell is Alan ? And where’s his party
? A Lan-Party (L.A.N. = Local Area Network) is a tournament of
video games, all linked on a network. During 2 days, 16th & 17th
of March, a fixed number of players (in this case : 300) will
engage in cybernetic warfare.
Four different games, that cover the whole spectre of game
types and possible confrontations, will be launched at the same
time : real time strategy (Starcraft - Broodwar), ‘Kill’em all’ for
teams (Counter Strike and Quake3 : Urban Terror) and for individuals
(Quake 3 and Deathmatch).
Naturally, the winners will be covered with prizes.
The spectators will be able to follow the tournaments on large
screens, where ‘live’-images of the games will be projected. The
results of all of the tournaments will be announced on Sunday,
the 17th of March, at 19:00 hrs.
The Bif3-LAN is a mutual project of the BIFFF and E-A renas (for

To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the festival former
guests were asked for a list of what, on the one hand, are the
classic films of the fantastic genre, and what, on the other
hand, are their personal favourites, their cult films.
The answers we received from John Carpenter, Joe Dante, Christopher
Lee, Raoul Servais, Jimmy Sangster, Lewis Gilbert, Ken
Russell, Harry Kümel, Shinya Tsukamoto, Alex Proyas and many
others resulted in a long list of movie classics with a remarkable
consensus on the top ten. During the festival these ten most
influential, most respected, best remembered films will be
screened at the Brussels Film museum.
A selection of cult favourites of the same illustrious company
will be shown throughout the whole month of March.
Jack Cardiff and Christopher Lee will honour the Brussels Film
Museum with their presence. They will introduce and discuss
both their own work and their film favourites.
On Thursday 28, Jack Cardiff introduces Sons and lovers, directed
by himself and Ghost story, for which he was director of
photography. On Friday 29, he will proudly present one of the
undisputed masterpieces of his work as a cinematographer :
Powell and Pressburgers’ A Matter of Life and Death (1946).
Christopher Lee will be both on and in front of the screen on
Tuesday 26. The triple bill that night will consist of The Private Life
of Sherlock Holmes (Billy Wilder, 1970), with Lee as Sherlock
Holmes’ brother Mycroft, The Wickerman (Robin Hardy, 1973) and

Edmond Jamoulle is Belgium’s last painter of movie
panels. Initiated at an early age, he naturally came to
realize advertising panels after attending the Royal
School of Arts. He soon became one of the best
designers of movie panels. Since the early 60’s, his
creations can be seen hanging above most cinemas in
Belgium. With the advent of large movie complexes,
calico painters have progressively disappeared.
Nowadays, cinemas prefer more modern and faster
techniques, such as computers, and panels which are
still made by hand can seldom be found. However,
Edmond Jamoulle still proudly practices his art according
to a process which has not or has hardly changed
through the years. A projector sends the enlarged
images of movie star pictures on a white canvas. Their
outlines are then drawn in pencil. The coloring process,
realized with airbrush and paintbrushes, together
with the lettering, is part of the final stage, for which
the artist receives the help of assistants. After being
exhibited, the canvas are whitened in order to be used
again, that is if someone is not interested in buying the
panel.
Edmond Jamoulle also makes use of his talent to create
sets and oil paintings. On the occasion of the 20th
anniversary of the Festival, he presents an exhibition
about the giants of fantasy cinema.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2002,event,Art Exhibition,,Festiv'Art 2002,"Dirk, De Keyzer",,,,"Dirk De Keyzer was born in Sleidinge, a small village near
Ghent, in 1958. For more than 20 years, he has been
going his own way in the world of sculptors. At first, he
experienced the fate of every starting artist: he
worked very hard but received little recognition. He
continued sculpturing persistently because, according
to him, it was the only thing he was cut out for.
Making sculptures is more of a predestination than
a choice for Dirk De Keyzer. Although he can very
easily appeal to his technical talent
while realising
his creations, the act of modelling challenges
him the most and really fulfils him with satisfaction.
Most of his sculptures represent self-willed
and elegant women, but priggish and slightly
eccentric little men also appear. They
show a zest for living without complexes
and encourage us to see things from the
right perspective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2002,event,Art Exhibition,,Planet of the Screens (Brussels Academy of Arts),"Gilles, Demoortel",,,,"PLANET OF THE “SCREENS”
A scenery designed by students from the evening class in Illustration & Comic-Strips at the Brussels
Academy of Arts.
The bar of the Festival of Fantasy Films is seen through the eyes of a zapping Big Brother. Hybrid
screens come out of the walls, revealing to the public a cathodic vision of a universe essentially
devoted to the cult of the screen.
The evening class in Illustration & Comic-Strips from the Brussels Academy of Arts leads its students
on an original search into creation around the narrative and sequential picture.
Illustrating or making comic strips is the pleasure of communicating, juxtaposing, articulating,
composing, clarifying and re-inventing the infinite relations between text and picture at the service
of the narrative and its audience, around stereotypes and conventions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“RED AND BLACK ”
20 years of the Brussels International Festival of
Fantasy, Thriller and Science Fiction Film
In March 2002, the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy,
Thriller and Science Fiction Film celebrates its 20th anniversary. In
order to mark this major event, the Belgian Centre for Comic Strip
Art and the Festival thought that an extensive retrospective exhibition,
showing the drawings made by comic strip artists for the
posters of the Festival, would be a very nice
cherry (a quite red one at that) on a very tasty cake (with real dark
chocolate).
Indeed, the draughtsmen chosen by the Festival form a genuine
high society address book. We are talking here about no less than
Buzzelli in 1983, Schuiten and Renard in 1984, Tardi in 1985,
Comès in 1986, Franquin in 1987, Rosinski in 1988, Loisel in 1989,
Nicollet in 1990, Boucq in 1991, Hergé in 1992, Sokal in 1993,
Bourgeon in 1994, Vance in 1995, Mézières in 1996, Bilal in 1997,
Hausman in 1998, Swolfs in 1999, Moebius in 2000, Franz in 2001
and E.P. Jacobs in 2002…
“The Red and the Black”, a delicious as well as disquieting exhibition
presents, author by author, the preparatory sketches for the
posters, as long as they have survived the passing of time, the
finished result and the silk-screen print. You will also be able to see
a selection of original plates by the draughtsmen in question.
Priority has been given to plates from series related to the
Festival’s three main themes: Fantasy, Science Fiction and Thriller.
Finally, for the gourmets among you, disturbing pieces by the
enigmatic artist G.A. van Horn will remind you that fear should
always be taken seriously. A word to the wise...
