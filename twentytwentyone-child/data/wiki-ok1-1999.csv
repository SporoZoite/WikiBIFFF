Interactive computer games have become the number one entertainment and their creators are treated as superstars. Now there is one game that beats all the rest. eXistenZ is a new organic game system which, when downloaded into humans, accesses their central nervous systems. It transports them to a different reality, changing every time it is accessed and adapting to those who are playing it. Besides fame, it has also brought danger to its creator Allegra Geller. A gang of fanatical Anti-eXistenZialists have put a bounty of $5 million dollar on her head. They have made her the target for murderous attacks with lethal gristle guns, made of organic matter and thus impervious to any metal detector. Allegra is saved from an Anti-eXistenZialist assault by Ted Pikul, a young security guard. To find out more about her assailants, she equips Pikul with his own Bioport, a device which will jack him into the game. This procedure almost goes wrong, due to the treacherous greed of Gas, a petrol station attendant who is after the bounty. With the assistance of game expert Kiri Vinokur, Allegra finally leads Pikul into the world of eXistenZ, where nothing is as it appears to be.
Still enjoying the international controversy caused by Crash, renowned Canadian director David Cronenberg (Videodrome, Scanners, Naked Lunch) pursues his obsessions by plunging into the world of sci-fi and virtual reality. With eXistenZ, Cronenberg takes us one step ahead of reality. He had observed that when people play videogames, they try to fuse themselves with the game. So he thought : “If I want to be the game, the game will also want to be me.” This fantasy has been made reality, physical and organical. This brings us to familiar Cronenberg territory. Under certain circumstances, we are capable of creating our own realities, whether through drugs or technological innovation. In the world of eXistenZ, the game has become flesh. To put his vision to the screen, Cronenberg assembled a top notch cast of actors. Jennifer Jason Leigh (Single White Female, Rush, The Hudsucker Proxy) plunges deep into her part as Allegra Geller. Jude Law (Shopping, Gattacca) plays her protector, Ted Pikul. Willem Dafoe (Mississippi Burning, Light Sleeper) portrays the greedy Gas and Ian Holm (Alien, Brazil, Naked Lunch) is Kiri Vinokur. They are assisted by Don McKellar (Last Night), Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter) and Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave, Jude)."

The loss of his wife, an agent who lost her life two years ago in an F.B.I. operation, weighs heavily on father and son. By circumstances, Michael and Grant become friends with their new neighbours, Oliver and Cheryl Lang. Pretty soon Grant and Brady, the Langs’ son, become inseparable. The mourning period of the Faradays seems to be over. But the better Michael gets to know his new neighbour, the more he catches him with ever increasing lies. Slowly the suspicion grows with Michael that something is wrong. His girlfriend Brooke thinks he’s being paranoid and jealous. To her, the Langs are the perfect family that Michael has lost. When Grant starts to spend more and more time with the Langs, Michael starts to search into Oliver’s past. He finds out that his neighbour is not the man he pretends to be. But who is he and what is really going on in the house at the other side of Arlington Road ?
Arlington Road is a bone-chilling psychological thriller that searches the limits between good and evil, between trust and treason and between suspicion and paranoia. Director Mark Pellington honed his skills with awarded videoclips such as Pearl Jam’s Jeremy and Inxs’ Beautiful Girls. His feature film debut Going All the Way, from 1996 with Jeremy Davies and Ben Affleck, was a big hit at the Sundance Film Festival. With Arlington Road he follows into the footsteps of Alfred Hitchcock. Are the suspicions of the protagonist grounded in truth or are they the product of personal delusions and paranoia ? Jeff Bridges (Starman, The Fabulous Baker Boys, The Big Lebowski) doesn’t know anymore who or what to believe as Michael Faraday. Tim Robbins (The Player, Bob Roberts, The Shawshank Redemption) plays the mysterious Oliver Lang. His wife Cheryl is a part by Joan Cusack (Working Girl, Married to the Mob, Adams Family Values) and Hope Davis (Flatliners, Kiss of Death, Next Stop Wonderland) plays Brooke Wolf."

After a boozy stint in the LAPD, Fritz spends his sometimes sober days repossessing cars and listening to Beethoven in his run-down PI office. When Fat Dog Baker, a maniacal caddie, whose wad of $ 100’s is nearly the size of his gut, knocks on his door, Fritz’s life changes forever. Fat Dog hires Fritz to rescue Jane Baker, a sexy 17 year old who Fat Dog claims to be his sister. She’s living with Sol Kupferman, a 70 year old Mafia insider, with a pair of red Rolls Royce’s parked in front of his posh Beverly Hills mansion. The twisted trail that Fritz follows leads him back to Haywood Cathcart, head of LAPD internal affairs, top notch scumbag and the reason that Fritz got kicked off the police force. What are Solly Kupferman and Haywood Cathcart up to ? How did Jane Baker get shacked up with Solly K ? And why does Fat Dog turn up mutilated and decomposing in a lonely shack in Ensenada ? As Fritz investigates, he’s propelled on a collision course with Haywood Cathcart. And this time around he stands to lose much more than his job. But if Fritz Brown can’t save himself, maybe he can save Jane Baker...
After L.A. Confidential, Brown’s Requiem is another cinematic excursion into the dark universe created by James Ellroy, the demon dog of American literature. There are no angels in Ellroy’s Los Angeles. It’s a seedy, decadent, rundown place where you can not tell cops and robbers apart. Greedy self-interest is the main drive of most of his colourful characters. This is no different in Brown’s Requiem, directed by newcomer Jason Freeland. Michael Rooker (Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer, Cliffhanger, Bram Stoker’s Shadowbuilder) plays Fritz Brown, a man with a past and maybe no future to look forward to. Jane Baker, the girl who might be his salvation or his downfall, is a part by Selma Blair (Girl, In and Out). Brion James (Blade Runner, The Fifth Element) delights in playing a complete and utter bastard like Haywood Cathcart. Will Sasso (Beverly Hills Ninja) comes to a gruesome end as Fat Dog Baker and Harold Gould (The Sting) is Sol Kupferman."

Later in the evening, a drunk and angry Mona calls in on Dr. Lack. There is something about him. His eyes seem to suck you in. He talks of Anne as his “patient”. And suddenly he asks Mona all the questions she has been dwelling upon as her wedding approaches. What is passion ? Do you know yourself ? Are you honest to yourself ? Mona realises that Anne has got involved in a sect led firmly by Dr. Lack and his cool wife Karen. A sect which offers its disciples a better life. At first Mona feels drawn by it, but she soon sees from Anne that this “better” life is filled with fear, uncertainty and abuse. Mona will try everything to free her friend from the clutches of the charismatic and dangerous Dr. Lack. But maybe she has already gotten too involved ? !
Danish director Susanne Bier, a graduate of the Danish National Film School, has already directed three features (Freud Leaving Home, Family Matters, Pensionat Oskar), which received a number of international awards. Her latest film, Credo, is a spine-chilling psychological thriller about sex, friendship, insecurity and the yearning for a life of passion. Her talented Scandinavian cast is led by Sofie Grabol (Pelle the Conqueror, Nightwatch, Isle of Darkness), Denmark’s hottest actress, as Mona. Anne is played by Ellen Hillingso, who made her debut in Ole Bornedal’s television series Charlot and Charlotte. The sinister Dr. Lack is a part by acclaimed Norwegian actor Sverre Anker Ousdal (Hansum). His wife Karen is played by the prominent Swedish actress Stina Ekblad (Fanny and Alexander, Freud Leaving Home)."

In Northern Ireland, now an independent state, elections are under way for the first Prime Minister. Catholic Michael Brinn is the frontrunner. Dan Starkey, a seedy and boozy newspaper columnist, meets an attractive young woman, Margaret, and invites her to his party. He’s caught kissing her by his wife Patricia, who throws him out. He spends the night with Margaret, who later gives him a cassette from a set given to her by her father. When he returns from buying pizza, he finds Margaret shot. Her dying words sound like “Divorce... Jack”. Starkey learns that Margaret’s father was Brinn’s right-hand man David McGarry. And that this information is dangerous, is proven when Starkey and visiting US reporter Charles Parker narrowly escape getting shot by a Protestant militia. Needing change to phone Patricia, he sells the cassette in a street market. But before he can get through to his wife, she gets kidnapped by masked man. Now wanted for Margaret’s killing and deeply in trouble, Starkey goes underground with Parker’s help. When he gets attacked again, Starkey gets away with the help of Lee, a nurse moonlighting as a “Nun-O-Gram”. By a chance remark of his attractive saviour, he discovers that Margaret’s cassette is at the same time the cause for and the possible solution to his precarious situation. A frantic search for the missing tape ensues.
Director David Caffrey and screenwriter-novelist Colin Bateman have managed to pull it off. They’ve made a sharp, witty and inventive comedy thriller about Northern Ireland. Caffrey, director of several admired shorts, and Bateman, who adapted his own novel for the big screen, have dug deep in the troubled soil of Northern Ireland. They came up with poignant dark humour, which they put in a pacey, narrow-eyed and tight plotted narrative. There are no favourites here. Both sides are being portrayed as self-serving, treacherous psychopaths. The cast, right down to the smallest bit part, relished getting their teeth into some juicy character creation. David Thewlis (Life is Sweet, Naked, Dragonheart) gives a vivid impression of a man disintegrating from the inside out as the cynical hack Dan Starkey. Rachel Griffiths (Muriel’s Wedding, Jude, My Son the Fanatic) steals the show as the feisty, tooled-up stripper nun Lee. US journalist Charles Parker (City Hall, The Big Lebowski, Godzilla) is a part by Charles Gant and Robert Lindsay (Genghis Cohn, Brazen Hussies, Fierce Creatures) is Michael Brinn. Just one parting thought. If the Coen brothers were Brittish, this would be the kind of movie they’d make."

There’s a war going on in the North of England. Estates like Pepperhill used to belong to the Warlords but now the Triads are taking over. They grew stronger and more daring while Terry and Ray were inside. But now the G Men are home and Terry wants his old territory back. It’s about power, it’s about respect, it’s about territory. Cousins and lifelong friends, Ray and Terry have always trusted and relied on one another, but now Ray is talking of breaking the rules. He doesn’t want to play gangster anymore, he is looking for something else, something legitimate. He wants out – he’s spent his life with a gun in his hand and now it’s time to stop the killing and make a life. To Terry, Ray is more than family. He’s everything. This isn’t about betrayal.

Everybody Loves Sunshine is an uncompromising and explosive account of urban warfare and the fear-driven gang loyalties which perpetuate it. Where a fight to get even becomes a fight to get out."

The spellbinding thriller The Fall is an intricately woven story of deceit, passion and murder. Set in Eastern Europe, where political transitions have led to a world of paranoia and fear, first-time British director Andrew Piddington combines elements of a Hitchcock thriller with a unique story of foreign intrigue and a sensual eroticism. To him it’s “all about heightened moments concentrated over one day, which all come together to change someone’s perspective.” Piddington has put his characters in an alien situation, where, confronted with their suppressed fantasies, they are thrown off guard and have to rely on their instincts to survive. The Fall stars Craig Sheffer (Nightbreed, A River Runs Through It, Reasonable Doubt) as Adam Ellis, a man whose life is changed in one afternoon. Hélène de Fougerolles (La reine Margot, Assasins, Que la lumière soit) is the mysterious Marta and veteran actor Jürgen Prochnow (Das Boot, In the Mouth of Madness, Judge Dredd) plays Jozsef Kovacs."

But the celebration goes too far. Next morning, Gulli wakes up besides the naked dead body of an young woman. He and his friends can neither recognise the woman nor remember what happened. This is the beginning of a fast and ominous chain of events, which nobody could have anticipated and none of them were prepared for. Questions arise, and nobody seems to have the answers. Where did the woman come from ? Who is responsible for her death ? Who took the photos ? Can you really trust your best friend... or your sweetheart ?
It can be called nothing but remarkable that a tiny island nation like Iceland with its 270.000 souls manages to have a small but thriving film industry. Maybe it’s the bubbling volcanic soil with its many active geysers and the empty, barren landscape that tickles the cinematic imagination of the Icelanders. Take No Trace for instance, a tense thriller by Hilmar Oddsson set in Reykjavik, the only real city on the island. Oddsson, who comes from a theatrical family, studied film in Münich, Germany. There he made shorts like In the Shadow of Scartaris, about the mysteries of the Snaefellsjökull glacier where Jules Verne had set his classic journey to the Centre of the Earth. After graduating, he completed his first long feature in 1986. The Beast, a psychological thriller about the fate of two young people in a remote and bleak landscape, was well received by the public and critics. His acclaimed second film Tears of Stone (1995), based on the life of the Icelandic composer Jon Leifs, was a hit on the international festival circuit and captured several prizes. With No Trace, you can now also sample a piece of this gifted Icelandic director."

This demon had invented a miraculous yellow liquid that was able to reanimate dead flesh. In the year of our lord 1231 Premutos made his bid for world domination by commanding an army of zombies against the living. Luckily for us, a courageous warrior manged to kill the evil one before he could carry out his plans. The legend of Premutos was written down by an alchemist, but over the ages his book and the tales of the Lord of the Dead became forgotten by history. Now there is only one copy left of this anti-bible. It was buried by a satanic farmer in 1942 in a place that is now Walter’s garden. Walter’s a weapon’s freak who’s about to celebrate his birthday. For this ocassion, he has invited some eccentric guests. There is Hugo, a surpressed weakling and his intrusive wife Edith. Also present are Tanya, a shy girl who used to be Hugo’s big love, and Christian, a sunny boy from South Africa with a weakness for alcohol. Then there are Walter’s stephchildren. Rosina is into kinky sex and the moronic Mathias has been plagued recently by disurbing visions of blood and zombies. Walter always plants a new tree on his birthday, but this time he digs up a suitcase. It contains the Book of Premutos and several small bottles filled with the yellow liquid, buried by the farmer 55 years ago.
In 1990 18-year old Olaf Ittenbach, together with director of photography and co-producer Michael Müller, made a videomovie called Black Past. Both made the film for themselves and never thought that it would interest the general public. But when a well known fanzine heard about the movie and gave it some rave reviews Olaf and Michael suddenly had money to make anoher movie. The result, the splatter-feast The Burning Moon (1992), was banned by the German authorities for showing too much graphical violence. Having to pay fines, Olaf and his crew had to lay low for awhile, but with some small contracts for television, they managed to raise the money for their first theatrical release. The horror-comedy Premutos : The Fallen Angel (1997) is a gigantic overdose of hacked off limbs and free flowing blood. German gore at its best. Do not forget to bring your barf-bags !"

After losing their parents, Michael and older brother Jody encountered the Tall Man, the caretaker of the Morningside Cemetery. They found out that he was an extraterrestrial grave robber, who compressed human corpses into alien zombie dwarf slaves. Jody learned the hard way and fell victim to his gruesome methods, which included flying metal spheres that impaled themselves in their victims’ foreheads. Traumatised, Michael was sent on a mental institution marry-go round for nine years. Now attempting to prove his unbelievable story, he contacts Reggie, an oddball ice-cream man who is one of the few witnesses to the Tall Man’s nefarious misdeeds. Having learned that the evil undertaker is again pillaging small town cemeteries and amassing a horde of miniature terrors, they set off to stop him.
Phantasm : OblIVion is an enthusiastic and imaginative mix of science-fiction and horror. The original Phantasm (1979) was a low-budget labour of love for director Don Coscarelli, who handled the cinematography and editing chores to boot. The result was a film low on logic but high on imagination. It was one of the last highlights of a bygone B-movie drive-in era before movie theatres became the exclusive domain of high profile blockbusters. After two major studio-backed sequels, Coscarelli has returned to the indie-frontline that he operates most naturally in. He raised the money on his own and went into production without any rules or restraints. The slapstick angle of the third film has been dropped for a return to the brand of bizarre action and dreamy, surreal horror that made the original installments such glorious nightmares. On the acting front, Angus Scrimm returns as The Tall Man, rejoining original cast members Reggie Bannister, Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury. Have fun with Phantasm : OblIVion."

Gabriel, the most powerful of God’s angels, has returned to earth with an attitude and an army of angels gone bad. His mission: to destroy God’s most treasured creation : mankind. Gabriel wants to prevent the birth of a child conceived by one of his kind, the angel Daniel, and one of God’s “monkeys”, the human woman Valerie. According to a prophecy, this baby will reconcile the angels and bring peace in Heaven. Gabriel employs the assistance of a teenage girl, Izzy, who has just committed suicide. He keeps her alive to assist him in his war against Daniel and the other angels, a war that will climax with a battle in Eden.
In 1995, God’s Army opened the festival. This movie by Gregory Widen, the creator of Highlander, enchanted us by its theme : a war among angels for the soul of mankind. Director Greg Spence (Children of the Corn : The Gathering) has further elaborated this theme and has injected it with some black humour. Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter, King of New York, The Funeral) shows his most frightening side as the Archangel Gabriel. Jennifer Beals (Flashdance, In the Soup, Four Rooms) carries the fate of humanity in her womb as Valerie Rosales.

The last bastion of freedom became a place called Lost Vegas, where Elvis was crowned King. But after forty rockin’ years, the King has died and the word is out : Vegas needs a new king. News of the now vacant throne spread quickly throughout the wastelands, attracting the attention of every guitar picking, sword swinging opportunist; including “Death” himself, vowing that Vegas shall fall and a new sound of darkness will fill the airwaves. He starts knocking off every would-be challenger that gets in his path, claiming their guitar picks like an Indian would claim scalps. A post-apocalyptic superhero in horn-rimmed glasses also follows that long blown out highway towards the mythological kingdom of Rock. Buddy, a mysterious and powerful hero of the classic kind, is as skilled with his guitar as he is with his samurai Sword. He’s a lone wolf rocker that’s all to willing to fill the King’s blue suede shoes. Thrown together with a bothersome kid whom he saves in a spectacular battle, Buddy and the kid form an unlikely team as they make their way across the wastelands, pursued by Death, hungry cannibals and the entire Russian army.
Six-String Samurai, a post-modern, post apocalyptic, Hong Kong action, klezmer rock ‘n roll Mad Max movie, was born when aspiring filmmaker Lance Mungia ran into actor and jack of all trades Jeff Falcon. Their twisted imagination came up with a super low budget indie flic, which they wanted to shoot in Death Valley, one of the hottest places on earth. After some torturous guerrilla filming they had blown away all their money and were left with just 25% of their film. Armed with a trailer and some flyers they managed to find the rest of the money at Robert Redford’s Sundance Film Festival. More exhausting shooting in Death Valley ensued, but the result was worth it. Six-String Samurai is wildly original and highly entertaining, a mixture of Akira Kurosawa with Elvis Presley, Tsui Hark with George Miller and John Woo with the Three Stooges. The music, something called “Siberian Surf Rock”, is taken care of by those Russian-born Rock & Roll surfers : the Red Elvises."""

Like a virus they spread quickly, becoming firmly wedged in our collective consciousness. Now, at New England’s Pendleton College - just named the safest university in the country – someone is making classic urban legends come true, with fatal results. But who’s doing it and why ? According to Pendleton’s American Folklore instructor, Professor Wexler, these tales are said to contain hidden moral lessons for their victims. Unfortunately, some of us have to learn it the hard way. First, student Michelle Mancini loses her head, courtesy of a well-sharpened axe. Then the campus’ practical joker Damon is left dangling from a tree. Beautiful and assertive student Natalie suspects a bizarre link between the murders. Soon, one by one, students, faculty staff, even pets are dying off in a variety of sadistic and wickedly flamboyant ways. Unfortunately, Natalie’s friends are too preoccupied with other things to consider the deaths might be more than coincidence. Meanwhile, the body count keeps going up...
Mutant crocodiles in the New York sewers, the guy who wakes up and finds out that his kidneys have been stolen, the family whose grandmother dies on vacation and drive back home with her body in the trunk... etc. The stories are completely false, but everybody believes them, because they heard it “from someone who’s heard it from someone”. These urban legends are the subject of an exciting new horror thriller from Australian debut director Jamie Blanks. The film stars Robert “Freddie” Englund (Nightmare on Elm Street, The Mangler, Wishmaster) as professor Wexler. Alicia Witt (Four Rooms, Mr. Holland’s Opus) is hot on the trail of a horrible killer as enterprising student Natalie. Among her unbelieving friends are Jared Leto (The Thin Red Line) as Paul, an aggressive student journalist who’s only interested in a story that will bring him eternal fame; Rebecca Gayheart (Nothing to Loose, Scream II) as best friend Brenda, whose concern for Natalie is put aside by her flirting with Paul and Tara Reid (The Big Lebowski) as Sasha, the host of a sex advice show who’s more interested in exploring the Kama Sutra with her boyfriend, than with the impending danger. James Chressanthis (Kingdom of the Blind, Judas Kiss) took care of the photography and Christopher Young (Hellraiser, Copycat, Species) composed the music."

In 1997 we presented Tesis, the feature film debut of young Spaniard Alejandro Amenabar (°1972). This gripping thriller was first awarded with our Silver Méliès and went on to win the Golden Méliès for the Best European Fantasy Film of the Year. With the surrealist psychodrama Abre los ojos (Open Your Eyes), Amenabar has confirmed our high expectations. He has combined thriller elements with science fiction in a sharp critique on our consumer-driven society, where moral scruples are more a nuisance that a necessity. Abre los Ojos also deals with the different ways in which we perceive reality and the contradictions that can emerge from this. In the cast, we find some familiars from Amenabar’s first movie.

But such is life. After that, he really could do without setting off on a wild goose chase with three crazy old Frenchmen who reveal they used to be documentary filmmakers specialising in strange and bizarre human stories. They seem to be more interested in thawing Henry’s tough exterior than getting to any particular destination. Henry begins to wonder if they are some kind of guardian angels. Slowly, through their irresistible humour and joie de vivre, they convince him to give up his humdrum life and try to find happiness before it’s to late. Henry leaves them and heads south, free for the first time in years. In a small town he crosses the path of Fatima, quite simply the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. He sets about courting her, aided and abetted by a cantankerous old pig farmer. But Fatima is not the uncomplicated beauty she seems. Henry has his work cut out to woo her and win her from the clutches of her dark and dominating mother. In the process, he discovers quite a few skeletons in the closet.
Animals, an intriguing tale of angels, demons and pigs, is the first long feature film of native New Yorker Michael di Jiacomo. He’s one of a new breed of writer-directors who combine a strong visual sensibility with a wholly American sense of humour. His short films have been awarded numerous prizes and earned him a place in the prestigious Writers/Directors fellowship at the Sundance Film Institute. For his long feature debut he managed to snatch up Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Little Odessa, The Cook, the Thief, his Wife and Her Lover) as the quirky and intense New York cabbie Henry. He is captivated by the striking beauty and mystery of Fatima, played by Israeli actress Mili Avital (Stargate, Dead Man, A Polish Wedding). Acclaimed actor-director John Turturro (Do the Right Thing, Quiz Show, Mac) is the sinister, well-dressed mugger and veteran Rod Steiger (On the Waterfront, In the Heat of the Night, Guilty as Charged) plays the grumpy old pig farmer."

Teamed with Morley Allen, a cynical veteran, the two investigate exaggerated truths and fictuous claims. But then everything changes when a series of events starts to alter her life. A patient in a psychiatric hospital accurately predicts several deaths, including Ali’s best friend. A young boy bleeds from his hand and feet and Brady, a mysterious man obsessed with death, becomes her new lover. Suddenly, the improbable stories she’s reporting about are becoming real and the fine line of reality is fading. At first it seems coincidental, but Ali soon discovers that it is not. The fabric of her life begins to unravel as she realizes these extraordinary experiences are all connected to her past. She should have died at fourteen. Ali was the sole survivor of a plane crash. She cheated fate and survived, upsetting the natural order of things. Now her past and present are converging head on as her fate is finally restored. The consequences will terrify you.
There are places on earth where powerful lines of energy intersect. At these points, strange things happen. This is known as “Convergence”. Convergence is the exciting new film from the talented young director-writer Gavin Wilding. After sharpening his skills on romantic comedy (The Raffle with Mark Hammill), psychological thriller (Listen with Brooke Langdon) and high tension drama (Stag with Mario Van Peebles, Kevin Dillon and Andrew McCarthy) he now takes on fantasy. What happens when tabloid headlines become reality is something that Cynthia Preston (Whale Music) will find out as Ali Caine. Adrian Paul, star of the Highlander Tv series, is her strange new lover Brady.

There’s Quentin, a cop, Rennes, a professional thief, Leaven, a student math wiz, Holloway, a psychologist, Kazan, an autistic adult and Worth, who claims to be one of the designers of the cube but has no idea about its purpose. This assortment of individuals seems random, even perverse. None of these people know why or how they were imprisoned. They are forced to find their way out. The deadly traps are as lethal as the threat of starvation and the mental dangers of paranoia, prejudice and egoism. Unanswered questions pop up on every side. Who created this diabolical maze, and why ? It soon becomes clear that each of them has a skill that could contribute to their escape. But tension rises and conflicts and struggles for power start to emerge. One thing is crystal clear : unless they learn to co-operate to work out the secrets of this deadly trap, none of them has very long to live.
Cube, a cross between a classic Twilight Zone episode and a balls-out early George Romero Shocker, is the spellbinding first film of Canadian Vicenzo Natali. Shot in less than a month on a single set in a Toronto warehouse and with a cast of high-energy actors, Cube proves that the spirit of edgy low budget genre cinema is still very much alive and well. Natali’s film extends the theme of an earlier short, Elevated, about three people under threat in a jammed lift. He has compared the experiences of his characters to those of ants “living in a world of giants, never understanding the forces that push and pull them through life”. And since there are no clues whatsoever about the origin of the Cube, its purpose or designs, the audience itself starts to feel like a seventh pawn in a fatal game. Unsettling, exciting and fascinating, Cube was honoured as “Best Canadian Feature Debut” at the 1997 Toronto International Film Festival. Now you‘ll be able to feel just as trapped as those protagonist on the big screen, desperately wanting to escape while knowing that death may lay in waiting behind every corner."

The walls are dirty, the study books are outdated and the burnt-out teachers drag themselves through their courses. There’s no money for excursions, new computers or the yearly drama class musical. Yet the crumbling hallways are filled with America’s future : loners, leaders, losers, hipsters and nerds. Like all adolescents, they have problems with parents who can’t understand them, teachers who have never understood them and raging hormones that are beyond control. But now the students of Herrington High are facing an even bigger challenge. They will have to save the world from an alien invasion.
That’s all we are going to tell, because it would be cruel to spoil the fun. The combination of renegade director Roberto Rodriguez (El Mariachi, Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn) and the hottest screenwriter in town, Kevin Williamson (Scream I & II, I Know What You Did Last Summer), has led to a unique sci-fi thriller. Teenage Angst, black humour, tension and stunning SFX are all blended into an exciting roller coaster ride of a movie. The bunch of students that have to save the planet are interpreted by upcoming players like Elijah Wood (The Ice Storm, Deep Impact), Josh Hartnett (Halloween : H20), Jordana Brewster (Tv’s As the World Turns) and Shawn Hatosy (In and Out, Dogma). The teachers that desperately try to control them are Robert Patrick (Terminator II, Copland), Bebe Neuwirth (Tv’s Cheers, Green Card), Salma Hayek (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, Dogma), Famke Janssen (Goldeneye, Deep Rising, Rounders), John Stewart (The Larry Sanders Show) and Piper Laurie (Carrie, Children of a Lesser God, Twin Peaks).

It was her dreams of deadly premonitions he would come to own. As Claire Cooper (Annette Bening) frantically tries to convince a cynical world of her mind link with a madman – bent on avenging his childhood lost – she realizes she has but one choice. To stop the killer (Robert Downey Jr.), she must become him… once and for all. Her seeming descent into madness proves the only sane solution. Fretful dreams and waking visions of a missing girl, an apple orchard and a town drowned long ago were the first to tear at Claire’s idyllic New England life with her husband Paul (Aidan Quinn). As the visions increased, so did the distance between them, compounding her urgency for police to heed her warnings of impending tragedy. The police, Paul and even her psychiatrist Dr. Silverman (Stephen Rea) remain deaf of the silent screams of future victims haunting Claire’s dreams.
From conception to conclusion, paranormal parallels run deep in In Dreams. Initially, the story sprang from an idea surrounding reports of police departments hiring psychics to track down murderers. Screenwriter Bruce Robinson was then commissioned to flesh out the plot. Later, Neil Jordan came aboard, drawn to the alluring yet murky aspect of the metaphysical world floated in a horror tale. It was what Jordan calls the “startling image” of the story’s opening that immediately grabbed him: divers probing the remains of a drowned town for the victims of a serial killer, while on the surface a tortured Claire Cooper, drowning in her relentless premonitions, probes the dephts of her dreams for clues to the killer’s next move."

The weather’s always nice. The local team never looses a game, bathrooms have no toilets and sex doesn’t seem to exist. The troubled teens will bring a dubious gift to Pleasantville. Once its unhabitants will have tasted the forbidden fruits of the nineties, the clock will never be turned back again.
The magical fantasy Pleasantville is inspired by the legendary Tv-series The Twilight Zone and classics like Frank Capra’s It’s a Wonderful Life. Debut director Gary Ross once wrote speeches for Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton. He is also known as the screenwriter for hit comedies such as Dave and Big. There’s a funny, political undertone that runs through his film. Pleasantville, where innocence rules and “family values” are supreme, is the kind of utopia that would give wet dreams to any self-respecting conservative. Tobey Maguire (The Ice Storm, Deconstructing Harry) and Reese Witherspoon (Fear, Freeway) are David and Jennifer. Also watch out for the late J.T.

And they’d better find him fast. Reiko’s son has also seen the video and he finds himself together with his mother on the list of future victims of the mysterious video.
Hideo Nakata’s Ring reminds you of Alejandro Amenabar’s Tesis and even a bit of David Cronenberg’s Videodrome. But it distinguishes itself from its illustrious predecessors by its ultra-graphic direction. Ring is a fantasy thriller with a tense atmosphere in which Nakata shows us an unfamiliar side of Japan : dark, violent and frightening.

The Storm Riders is an ambitious attempt to replicate a popular martial arts manga on the big screen with elaborate CGI work and location shooting in China. Faced with a manga that’s been running for nine years, with no conclusion in sight, scriptwriter Manfred Wong only adapted the first third. Director Andrew Lau brings visual elan to the movie and both Kwok and Cheng, with their flashing-eyed looks, long hair and designer leather duds, impressively incarnate the spirit of the manga heroes."

Sabu, one of Japan’s hottest young filmmakers, is back with his latest off-beat action movie. After his explosive debut, the gripping D.A.N.G.AN. Runner, he became famous with his second feature Postman Blues, one of the most successful releases in Japan. With Unlucky Monkey, Sabu goes beyond the action-driven plots of his earlier films and emphasises the inner turmoil of his characters, as they find themselves trapped in a nightmare without relief."

Through a call to her show, she learns that her estranged lover, Victor, has been found dead; impaled on a cemetery fence located in a small Spanish village. After consulting Victor’s mentor, she learns that he was involved in bizarre experiments searching for tortured souls trapped behind the energy of our every day world. Lara embarks on a quest to find the answer behind his brutal and mysterious demise. She isolates herself in the small town and encounters an ensemble of various characters bent on keeping the secrets of the village hidden. Her search for the truth behind Victor’s death leads her to a strange house where screaming faces seem to form within the stones of the walls, moving about like living creatures. A nightmarish scenario ensues as she is plunged further into insanity, horror and the unknown.
99.9 is the most recent film from renowned Spanish director Agustin Villaronga. In 1985, this former artistic director and film critic made a terrifying debut with his perverse but disturbingly first feature In a Glass Cage. The story of an invalid Nazi doctor’s terrible past being re-created in his home by an insane former boy lover devastated and shocked the art film world. Followed by Moonchild in 1988 and El Andalus in 1992, his latest is a gorgeousy photographed and genuinely creepy film (it has already won two awards for its cinematography). 99.9 seethes in cool blue tones and works a methodical storyline paced like a sexually deviant Agatha Christie mystery. Fans of the X Files will find themselves in familiar thematic territory, but Villaronga’s subversive touch and perverse, morbid fascinations plunge into set pieves that are visually and atmospherically similar to some of Dario Argento’s films like Suspiria and Inferno. 99.9 will teach you that terror, indeed, has a number.

His constant conflicts with the few directors who still want to hire him, are threatening to get him thrown of the stage for good. Even worse, his difficult character does not really allow for stabile relationships. And at the moment he is passionately in love with his ex-girlfriend Sylvia, a psychologist. Unfortunately, she’s going to marry his dependable and pragmatic friend Dave and she’s going to do so tomorrow. The two broke up because Victor told her that he was having an affair. When a last-ditch campaign to win Sylvia’s heart back fails, Victor drowns his sorrows and pours out his heart to nubile barmaid Diane. Having set his mind on ending it all, he stumbles out drunk into the night. As he leaves, Diane gives him a magic umbrella. Suddenly Rafael and Don Miguel, two eccentric dustmen, show up. They take Victor to their trash-filled hangar and by some unexplainable sorcery they send him back into time, to just before the moment he was about to tell Sylvia that he was cheating on her. Now he has the opportunity to replay his life and correct his mistakes.
The Man with Rain in his Shoes is a charming romantic comedy by Spanish director Maria Ripoll. It elaborates on the point that a life replayed may not repeat the same mistakes, but most likely others will take their place. Ripoll learned the tricks of the trade as an assistant-director for well-known names such as Bigas Luna for El nino de la luna and Agusti Villaronga for Estacion Central. She completed her education with a three year stint at the American Film Institute, where she made several shorts. Upon returning to Spain, she worked on many television productions. The Man with Rain in his Shoes, a British-Spanish co-production, is her long feature film debut. Douglas Henshall (Dennis Potter’s Lipstick on Your Collar, Angels and Insects, Kull the Conqueror) gives a bravado performance as Victor. Lena Heady (Remains of the Day, Devil’s Advocate, Face) is very convincing as the whiny, passive Sylvia. Mark Strong (Tv’s Prime Suspect, Fever Pitch) plays Dave and the enchanting Penelope Cruz (Jamon, Jamon, Carne Tremula, Abre Los Ojos) portrays the luscious Louise, an aspiring novelist who catches Victor’s eye.."

The animal disappears unseen into the woods. Later, when his grandmother is found horribly mangled, he begins to believe that he might be a werewolf. And since werewolves don’t know what they have done afterwards, Thomas begins to search. He wants to find out what really happened during the night of the murder and what is happening to himself. The conclusions which he comes to, are appalling. Each piece of evidence points towards his guilt. And to his otherness... the beast within him. His initial shock at this realisation is replaced by a feeling of a yet unknown level of consciousness. Thomas wins the heart of Alexandra, the woman he had secretly desired for a long time. Wanting to protect her and be absolutely certain about himself, he attempts to document his transformation into a werewolf during the full moon. Thomas has to catch his breath when he finally finds out the truth about himself and the series of murders. For reality has taken over and is worse than all fantastic mythical creatures could ever be...
Werewolves galore... or not ! ? Hair-raising tension is guaranteed in the exciting German thriller Nicht Time. Director Peter Fratzscher (Panische Zeiten, Asphaltnacht, André Schafft Sie Alle) is not unfamiliar to tight plots, having directed numerous episodes of the popular German crime-series Tatort and Ein Fall für Zwei. With Sieben Monde he wanted to created an atmospheric mystery thriller within a genrefilm. By playing with the conventions and the rules of the genre, he succeeds in manipulating our expectations and manages to keep us surprised till the very end. His talented cast was essential to this. Popular German actor Jan Josef Liefers (Rossini oder die mörderische Frage wer mit wem schlief, Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door) is very convincing as the writer who tries to find his inner-wolf. Marie Bäumer, who became a star overnight with her part in Til Schweiger’s popular comedy Männerpension, sparks as the beautiful passionate Alexandra. Also watch out for Peter Lohmeyer (The Killer Condom !) as Chief Commissioner Graf."

God is writing the divine script “Let There Be Light”. He hopes to communicate his message to all mankind through the silver screen. But he has to find the right director to interpret his vision. His trusted assistant Angel René encourages him to seek the right person on Earth. God descends and lands in the Mecca of movies : “Hollywood”. This turns out to be a disaster of biblical proportions. God is not “a player” and he hasn’t the faintest idea how to pitch a script. He is cast out. Maybe he’ll have more luck in France. Despite René’s warning that French cinema is in a state of perpetual crisis, God heads towards Paris. Taking on many forms - from a beautiful blonde to a pigeon - he finally finds his director, a young woman called Jeanne Archambaud. God believes in her talent but she doesn’t believe in Him. It takes several tricks and miracles to gain Jeanne’s confidence before she starts to take the whole project seriously. Now she has to find the money to make it happen. Jeanne meets the right man in the person of the megalomaniac, double-faced producer Harper. After all, who better to decide how to mess up the film than the Devil himself...
In Arthur Joffe’s (Harem, Alberto Express) new comedy, aspiring filmmaker Almighty God has to take on many forms in the shape of François Morel (Le bonheur est dans le pré), Sergio Castellito (L’Uomo delle stelle), Arielle Dombasle (Un indien dans la ville) and even Catherine Jacob (Merci la vie) to get his vision on the silver screen. You can tell that Joffe’s movie is the product of a real dreamer who believes that movies can change the world. But that doesn’t stop him from inserting numerous ironic twists to make his message easier to digest. Nor did he hesitate to give the starring part to a young upcoming actress. Hélène de Fougerolles (Le péril jeune, Chacun cherche son chat, Assasins) gives a stunning performance as Jeanne Archambaud, God’s messenger on Earth. Ticky Holgado (Delicatessen, Gazon Maudit) plays his faithful assistant René, while Tcheky Karyo (Crying Freeman, Les milles merveilles de l’univers, Dobermann) is the Devil incarnated as Harper."

During this attack, his three accomplices and his fiancée Alice were killed in a shoot-out with the police. Ten years later, a similar attack takes place and the French Secret Police suspect a connection with the Mansart case. They request the help of a judge who handled the case before and of a team of well known psychologists who have accomplished ground-breaking research in the field of cyberspace. They want Mansart to relive the attack as well as the period of his life just prior to the event, in the hope of finding more clues as to what really happened. Dr. Rivall and his assistant Marianne have two different views on the ethical ramifications of the experiment. Rivall sees this as a chance to revolutionise investigative methods while Marianne is concerned about the human aspect. The judge is also doubtful, but nevertheless he convinces Mansart to participate in the experiment by promising him a shortened prison term and better cell conditions. The results are astounding.
Established Italian writer, producer and director Sergio Gobbi (Le Temps des Loups, L’Arbalète, L’Affaire) plunges into virtual reality with Rewind. In his own words : “In a world jaded by rational thinking, I wanted to use the thriller format to make a film about the desire to extend the limits of reality and to shatter an otherwise tangible world”. He has turned this view into an exciting ride that combines virtual reality, political machinations, betrayal and love. To put all of this on the screen, he could count on an excellent ensemble of actors. Popular Italian actor Raul Bova (La Lupa, Il Sindaco, La Frontera) plays terrorist Paul Mansart. Sceptical assistant Marianne is a part by Dutch actress Maruschka Detmers (Prenom Carmen, Le Diable au Corps, Hidden Assasin). Niels Arestrup (Le Grand Soir, The Tempation of Venus, Delit Mineur) is Dr. Rivall and Cécile Pallas (Le Voleur d’Enfant, L’Effet Pavillon, Tenue Correcte Exigé) plays Alice, the woman who holds the key to Mansart’s heart."

It contains the history of a vampire that has terrorised the region for centuries, but ended when people succeeded in locking him up inside a tomb. What the trio doesn’t realise is that they have started the liberation of this doomed soul.
Angel of the Night seems like a return to the horror movies of the seventies. It’s the kind of movie where fresh faced teenagers with names like Sandy, Billy or Johnny find themselves locked up in a frightening place where they spend their time trying not to get killed by the monsters that haunt them. In Angel of the Night they listen to names like Sören, Lars or Annika and their blonde hair is 100% natural. The movie is a loving parody in which Shaky Gonzales juggles with different periods of history. Watch out for the performance of Ulrich Thomsen, the hero from Thomas Vinterberg’s acclaimed Festen."

Paul D, an old friend who comes to visit Sethe, is tested by her household’s secrets.

Palmer is opening gifts when he comes across a beautifully wrapped box that contains a shin bone. The note in the box says, “Here’s your agent.” Palmer is appalled, not only because of the gruesome gift, but also because he was tormented by a killer who used the same modus operandi twelve years earlier. Questioned by the police, Palmer pulls himself together so he can attend a party celebrating his son Peter’s promotion to medical examiner for Seattle. Peter is taking over the job his father once held. At the party, Peter receives an ankle bone in his pile of presents. Palmer must let him know that the terror is starting again. The killer sends bones from his victim to several other people important in Palmer’s life as well as to the newspapers to bring attention to his own sick crimes.
Literally bone-chilling tension in Bone Daddy, a thriller by Mario Azzopardi, who honed his directing skills on several well known fantasy TV-series such as Stargate, The Outer Limits, Sliders and Highlander.

Stitching and sampling the remnants of the doll together in her mobile home, she invokes a voodoo chant and the smart-mouth Chucky is back in the sort of lethal business he engaged in as a flesh-and-blood felon. However, the reunion with Tiffany quickly shows signs of strain. Chucky doesn’t want a girlfriend ten times bigger than him. Realising that her dreams of a cosy little family are out of the question, Tiffany starts to use brute force to keep her Frankenstein doll under her thumb. But you can’t keep a good psycho puppet down. While Tiffany is taking a bubble bath, Chucky pushes in a radio and fries his former ex. He repeats the chant that transferred his soul into a doll, placing Tiffany’s spirit into a bridal figurine. Now two puppets with an excessive taste for blood are about to be set loose on the world.
Thank the Gods that Wes Craven’s Scream gave new life to scary movies with its nineties injection of black humour, hipness and horror. Now the notorious Child’s Play series, which had run a bit out of ideas and inspiration, is back on the big screen. Bride of Chucky is part horror, part comedy, part romance and part road movie. Hong Kong director Ronny Yu (The Bride with White Hair, Warriors of Virtue) accentuates the tongue-in-cheek elements of Don Mancini’s screenplay and provides an energetic style for this flight of fantasy. Avoiding easy campiness for a mix of cynicism and shock, Bride of Chucky has the good sense not to take itself very seriously. This cool blend of the genuinely creepy and the really funny, is brought with gusto by a enthusiastic cast of actors. Oscar nominee Jennifer Tilly (Bullets over Broadway, Liar, Liar) plays Tiffany, the over-the-top girlfriend of Chucky, whose voice comes, as usual, from Brad Dourif (Dune, Death Machine, Alien 4). Nick Stabile and Katherine Heigl (Prince Valiant, My Father, the Heroe) play a young trailer trash couple who are fortunate enough to be neighbours to the demonic dolls. John Ritter (Stay Tuned, It came from the Sky) is a nosy cop hot on their trail."

Not so for Tim, Evelyn and Niclas, three high school students in their final year. There’s an extra exam they have to sit through. Everything appears to be normal. Tim worries more about what to do after he graduates, than about the exam itself. Evelyn tries to pull together her courage to make that phone call to her dream date and Niclas passes the time listening to music and chewing gum. Then, suddenly, their teacher disappears and things start to get strange. It becomes totally dark outside and they can no longer leave the building. All the exits are closed and the phone is dead. When a strange person dressed in black appears in the corridors, the three start to get really worried. Together, they try to reveal the secret of the darkness. Niclas wants to leave the building by climbing out of a window with a fire hose. But even this way out leads into darkness. The school appears to float in empty space. Hiding in the chemistry lab, their thoughts are occupied by the mysterious person in black who’s somewhere out there, waiting for them...
Directors Philipp Stennert and Jakob Ziemnicky were high school students themselves in 1993 when they started working on the script for Dark. The idea of three students in a school surrounded by nothing but darkness and looking for a way out needed two years to grow into a full script. But by then, shooting the film seemed unlikely because of all the ideas for special effects and costly scenes. But in 1996 a small production company offered some technical support and, after a few rewrites, the directors convinced a crew and cast of friends to work for fun. With the majority of the 200.000 Bfr budget spent on pizza to keep everybody happy during 14 hour shoots, Stennert and Ziemnicky managed to pull off a tour de force. With a very effective use of black and white film, editing and music, they have created an atmosphere of constant tension and unease. Considering the minimal means, the result is truly remarkable. So join our three students, as they are confronted with their dreams and fears in Dark."

As Murdoch seeks to unravel the twisted riddle of his identity, he is drawn deeper and deeper into the murky city where he stumbles upon a fiendish underworld controlled by a group of ominous beings collectively known as The Strangers. These shadow-like figures possess the ability to stop the time and alter the city and its inhabitants - a bizarre, transmogrifying process known as Tuning. Through some evolutionary quirk, Murdoch is also imbued with this power and thus, he alone is able to resist The Stranger’s control over his mind. And for that, he must be destroyed.
Dark World is a noir-ish tale set in a ‘30s-’40s-style “City That Never Was,” which features murder, mayhem, mind control and malevolent presences. The film is produced by Andrew Mason and directed by Alex Proyas - both having fulfilled those duties on the equally dark The Crow. The casting of Rufus Sewell (Carrington) and William Hurt (Michael, Smoke), as a man accused of a series of murders and the detective searching for him, rounds out the gray color scheme."

Convicted of hideous crimes, the doctor was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in a mental hospital. But now Feinstone has escaped the high security institution, vowing never to return. With a new alias, Larry Caine, he relocates to the tiny farm town of Paradise, Missouri, where he aims to build a new life. Meeting the beautiful Jamie Devers, he finds himself falling in love. But it’s a relationship that threatens to unravel the terrifying truth about the doctor. Encouraged by Jamie to take on a temporary position as the community’s dentist, Feinstone wonders if his love for her will overpower his desire to kill. But within minutes of applying a scalpel on his first patient, he is transformed into his former deranged self. Snapping out of his uncontrollable rage, he discovers the brutalised remains of his patient. And the more patients the doctor sees, the more gruesome the murders become. But as Jamie’s friends start to become suspicious about the town’s new stranger, Feinstone must destroy them before they drill up his chilling past.
The original Dentist by genre veteran Brian Yuzna (Society, Return of the Living Dead III) toured the world-wide fantasy film festival circuit to rave reviews from fans of gory black comedy. This super-graphic follow-up is even more squirm-inducing than its predecessor. It plunges greedily into acts of oral mayhem that will hit a special nerve in anyone who has felt the frightening helplessness of the dentist’s chair. Returning in the title role, familiar television actor Corbin Bernsen (L.A. Law, The Cape) will undoubtedly surprise and stun those that are used to his more mainstream parts. While the original was a stabbing send-up of Los Angeles’ flaky New-Age medicine scene, The Dentist 2 attacks the charms of small town America. This film never loses sight of director Yuzna’s admirable intentions : “I want to make a film that will do to dentistry what Jaws did for water.”"

But Hanan won’t give up that easy, he will do whatever it takes to be accepted by Léa’s father, including living his life according to the rules of religion.
The Dybbuk of the Holy Apple Field is a Jewish version of the classic Romeo and Juliet theme. Boy gets murdered and girl is possessed by his spirit. The spiritual aspect of the movie is a very significant one: through the world of the spirits and metaphysics, and via the roles of the mediators between this earth and other entities, we are able to get a glimpse into the orthodox-traditional Jewish way of life.

In a rugged place on the coastline, he meets Jennifer, a woman who has lived all her life in a decripit house, alone with her brother. Jennifer falls in love with Jack. But as she’s drawn closer to him, she feels that Jack has a dark secret clawing at his soul. It reminds her of an old folktale : “Once upon a time there was an angel who decided to descend to earth and bring love to those living on it... When the first humans saw him in all his splendour, they were afraid of him and terrified because of his stately wings and his nine heads.” A cruel game starts in which the borders of fantasy and reality fade and in which Jack and Jennifer have to face what they fear most : Love.
Misguided Angel is a romantic thriller with elements of fantasy. It is full of suspense, passion and hope. Director Stefan Jaeger manages to mix the profane with the religious through a subtle game of metaphors. This makes the movie go beyond the love story it seems to tell. Jack’s dualism does not only mirror the eternal battle between Good and Evil, it also opposes the Book (the biblical story) against the Word (the folk legend). And in between is the eternal dilemma of opening up to love and becoming vulnerable or closing oneself off from love to avoid getting hurt. Misguided Angels shows us that even winged messengers are not immune to these matters of the heart."

They not only eliminate corrupt individuals, but any and all who have managed to evade conventional justice. The organisation is sustained by the charisma of its leader, KMB, whose real identity is a mystery: a master of disguise who has convinced the populace – workers, artisans and businessmen alike – to become both jury member and hired executioners. As usual, Hortson, Eugene, Ferguson, Spanky, Berghofer and others come together to act as jurors in the corruption trial of lawyer Behar. His subsequent demise leaves the lovely Mrs. Behar a widow. Leo Stoychev is left with a limp after a botched assassination attempt and holds his employer, Branco responsable. He contacts Mordburo, but unaware of the organisation’s rules unwillingly finds himself at the center of a trial which condemns Branco to death.
After four successful shorts, Lionel Kopp makes his feature film debut with Mordbüro, a contemporary film noir that was shot in Paris and Bulgaria. This fantasy thriller can be considered as a plea against “ street justice ” and uses the services of actors such as Ornella Muti (Flash Gordon, Storie di ordinaria follia, Wait until Spring Bandini), Dominique Pinon (Delicatessen, La Cité des enfants perdus, Alien Resurrection), Patrick Catalifo (Diên Biên Phu, A cause d’elle, La joie de vivre) and Philippe Clévinot (Merci la Vie, Camille Claudel, Le Mari de la coiffeuse)."

Obviously, Uncle Martin doesn’t want to be identified. In fact, all of Tim’s efforts to divulge the truth are systematically thwarted by the resourceful alien who ultimately recruits Tim to help him repair his ship for a return to Mars. They eventually become pals and join together to overcome the many hilarious obstacles that confront them along the way.
The intergalactic comedy My Favorite Martian is a big screen adaptation of the classic television series from the sixties. Director Donald Petrie seemed to be the right man for the job, having experience with television and with comedy. He made several episodes of popular series such as L.A. Law, McGyver, Amazing Stories and Chicago Hope. Furthermore, he directed the legendary couple Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau in Grumpy Old Men. Jeff Daniels (Pleasantville, Dumber & Dumber, Speed) desperately tries to prove as Tim O’Hara that his Uncle Martin - played by Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Adams Family) - is an alien from another planet. There are assisted by Elizabeth Hurley (Austin Powers, Passenger 57, Mad Dogs & Englishmen) as Brace Channing, Daryl Hannah (Blade Runner, Splash, Attack of the 50Ft Woman) as Lizzie and veteran actor Ray Walston (The Sting, Paint Your Wagon, The Appartment), the original “Martian” from the series, as Armitan.

The second family is more modest in origins. Radlov is an engine driver who lives with his daughter Lisa, a dreamy woman of twenty years old. If there is someone Lisa hates, it is the maid of the house, Grunya, who became her father’s mistress when her mother died. She also suspects Grunya of having an affair with Johann. But he is more interested in Lisa. She would be the perfect prey for his perversions.
Despite the catastrophic economic situation, there are still inventive films being made in Russia. Shot in the famous style of the classical portraits by the turn of the century and with a poker-faced irony, Of Freaks and Men is a dazzling perverse black comedy. Director Alexei Balabonov started as a documentary filmmaker. He made his first long feature film, Happy Days, in 1992. This was followed by The Castle in 1994 and Brother in 1997, which gained him world-wide attention. It became Russia’s biggest box office hit and made its world première at Cannes in the Quinzaine des Réalisateurs. Brother went on to win the Special Jury and Fipresci prizes at the Turin Film Festival and received Best Actor Awards from Chicago and the Russian Critics Guild. His newest film, Of Freaks and Men, is a haunting melodrama of hidden passions and sadomasochistic urges.

And Mina, the youngest daughter, is upset by the strange noise at night and the ominous omen of an odd old woman. At last, two weeks after the opening, the first guest appears. Excited, the family spoils him excessively. However, the following day the guest is found dead in his room and the family has to bury him to avoid any risk of ruining their business. The next guests are a couple who commit double suicide and, consequently, the family has to bury them again. After a while, the family gets used to the digging, but there’s a new menace on the horizon. The bodies are in danger of being dug up by the advancing road construction works beside the guesthouse. To make things worse, the head of the village gets involved in the conspiracy.
The Quiet Family, nicknamed a “ruthless comedy” by director Kim Ji-Woon, is not the kind of film that would fit in the diet of soap operas, comedies and action movies that Korean and Asian audiences are used to. This black horror comedy walks a tight rope between tension and laughter. And Kim Ji-Woon, who also took a writing credit, has injected his long feature debut with some potent social critic. The film deals with the conflicts between generations - each member of the family represents a distinctive generation that is at odds with the others - and with the obsession of accepted members of society towards outsiders. When you loose your job, you become an outcast. The family have isolated themselves from the mainstream of hectic modern life and the unfortunate lodgers they receive are the wreckage of a society adrift. And it all takes place in the cramped space of the guest house. The Quiet Family, a cross between the haunted house and a cruel dark satire, is truly a very unusual Korean film that is worth seeing."

The Rugrats Movie finds the Pickles family facing the biggest adventure to happen in any household – the birth of a new baby. As Stu and Didi Pickles struggle with the changes associated with the arrival of baby Dylan (Dil), big brother Tommy and his pals Chuckie (his phobic best friend), twins Lil and Phil (an erstwhile Greek chorus), and 3-year-old Angelica (the crabby, charismatic foil who communicates with both babies and parents) decide that the baby’s antics are cramping their style and attempt to take him back to the “hop-sickle.” Attempting the trip to the hospital in one of Stu’s wacky inventions, the Reptar Wagon, the Rugrats lose their way and end up lost in a vast forest, populated by looming shadows, a wily wolf, a mysterious wizard and a group of hungry monkeys that have escaped from the circus.
Rugrats is the most popular children’s series on US television.

Samurai Fiction is a not-so-typical samurai movie. Director Nakano incorporates versatile camera work and adds an innovative style to this popular genre. His film is a tribute to the legendary director Akira Kurosawa. Nakano faithfully revives Kurosawa’s style through the composition of the black-and-white scenes and the sword-fighting duels. Samurai Fiction is a faithful introduction for those unfamiliar with the genre and a funny “find the hidden picture” quest for the initiated."

When he gets out of jail, he leaves the girl in a charity institution and moves to Lille. There he lives despairingly with his pregnant girlfriend, for whom he has nothing but loathing, in her elderly mother’s flat. The butcher finds the place disgusting and unhygienic. He also hates old people; but then he hates everybody and everything apart from the impossible memory of a father he never knew. He was a communist resistance hero who was murdered in the death camps. His girlfriend has promised him a new life and a butcher’s shop. But it’s all a lie. When she accuses him of infidelity, the butcher explodes, punching her repeatedly in the stomach to kill the baby. Taking the old woman’s gun and with a dwindling 300 francs between himself and destitution, he hitches a ride to Paris where he might get lucky again. But alone, with no friends, job or home and as only company the gun, the butcher sees only one way out : vengeance. Alone against everyone, the butcher will take on humanity.
Seul contre tous is a hard, gripping drama that shows life as it is, marked by tragedy, violence and despair. The movie is a feature-length follow up to director Gaspar Noé’s acclaimed medium-length Carne, in which the same character, the butcher, tries to bring up his autistic daughter in a nightmarish world of blood, horsemeat, stunted relationships and frustrated sexual desire. It was directly indebted to David Lynch’s Eraserhead, which Noé describes as “the closest thing to a nightmare” he had ever seen on the screen. Despite the success of Carne, it took Noé six years to complete Seul contre tous, finding it hard to raise money and support to back up his extreme and not very commercial project. On the way he got constantly snubbed by what he calls “the huge family of soft bourgeois French cinema.”. Nonetheless, he managed to pull it off. Seul contre tous is a dark, uncompromising feel-bad experience that inscribes itself into the tradition of powerful and confrontational movies like Sam Peckinpah’s Straw Dogs or Martin Scorcese’s Taxi Driver.

Against the dark backdrop of small-town life, Harry Odum lives with his housebound, watchful mother, Kate, a former lounge singer who lives on memories and a strong attachment to her son. Prone to vicious bursts of aggression, Harry catches the eye of the local crime bosses and with the help of his “homeboy” pal, Arnie, slides easily into the ranks of the organization. His education takes him beyond the walls of his drab home. When Harry encounters Iris – his boss’s crippled yet hauntingly beautiful maid – he also travels beyond the psychological barriers of his stunted development. As Harry delves deeper and deeper into the cold brutality of organized crime with its ironic emphasis on loyalty and family, his own illicit actions engender fierce consequences. At the same time, Kate, who at first seemed to accept her son’s relationship with Iris, becomes menacingly possessive. As events spin around him, the same dark urges that made Harry a first-rate hit man, threaten to sweep him away in an undertow of twisted sexuality, betrayal and self-destruction.
Spanking the Monkey meets semi-organized crime in Six Ways to Sunday, a black comedy awash in fine, quirky perks, queasy subtext and a defiantly odd-ball tone. Rock-video vet Adam Bernstein is perfectly comfortable with the gleefully discomfitting material, adorning a creepy premise with visual and musical asides that render the unconventional proceedings palatable and frequently funny. Norman Reedus is to Harry what Bud Cort was to Harold in Harold and Maude, perfectly embodying the blend of gawky teenhood and incipient macho bravado needed to put the character across. Deborah Harry is soothingly peculiar as the suffocating parent who couldn’t be nicer or more inappropriate in her approach."

In desperation, Filo takes a job as a video stringer for a company supplying video reports on nightly crimes and disasters occurring in the city. A modern version of the ambulance chaser, Filo is at first disgusted by the images he is required to shoot. But he slowly becomes drawn into the voyeurism that his job requires. As his boss Wolko pressures him to get more graphic material, Filo begins to loose himself in the images he feels compelled to capture. When Marie walks out on him, Filo slips deeper into his own private video hell.
In the tradition of Taxi Driver, Stringer is a gripping melodrama, a reflection of the times we live in. German director Klaus Biedermann, who has made tv-thrillers like Tatort-Frankfurt-Miami and Dark Desires : Eva, draws a sharp portrait of today’s media madness. More than ever, something has only taken place if we’ve seen it on television. The Stringers are contemporary media vampires, feeding on our lust for cheap thrills, blood and sex. But at the same time they are also victims of a relentless pressure to keep the public entertained with all the horrible things that always seem to happen to “the others”. Where will it end ?!

No longer able to boast of living in the place that turned out “the finest damned nuts in Canada” folks kind of drifted away. All that’s left is the General Store, which boasts the region’s finest shelf display of “adult literature”; the Fawkes Den Motel, first prize for the least visited motel in North America; and a skeleton staff of self-appointed law-keepers that talk all day about the only two topics that interest the remaining inhabitants : television and sex. A momentary distraction is offered when atom scientist Dr. Karel Lamonte shows up in Exceptional Vista. He immediately becomes the object of passionate affection for Sandy Fawkes, the local town vamp. Then suddenly, one morning, the power goes off and, with it, the Tv. Even with generators, the small screen stays dead. It gets worse. Pretty soon, people begin to disappear... or bits and pieces of them do. Chewed remains are being found. In the words of Guy, a local boy who wasn’t first in line when brains were being handed out : “It’s like some kinda... some kinda... big eating thing is going on”.
It seems like something has replaced man on top of the food chain in this movie by the same name. Canadian director John Paizs (Crimewave) and veteran comedy writers Phil Bedard and Larry Lalonde have created a hilarious and gory spoof of all those old sci-fi movies of the fifties. Once you’ve seen them, you know what they are about. Monsters turn up to threaten the earth and a scientist talks a lot of gibberish that you don’t understand, but it always seems to have something to do with atomic radiation. Tom Everett Scott (Big Night, The Spanish Prisoner) plays Dr. Lamonte, the earnest scientist who tries to explain away the alien monsters and man-eating blobs. Campbell Scott (That Thing You Do, American Werewolf in Paris) is small-town simpleton Guy. Sandy Fakes, a girl who seems to have picked up her ideas about love from watching too much television, is a part by Fiona Loewi (National Lampoon’s Senior Trip, Love and Death on Long Island)."

This is the start of three wicked, wildly irreverent stories, set in a warped, grotesque world. Paletta has to endure all sorts of humiliations but can not find an outlet for his sexual desire. When he learns that Tremmotori, a well known whore, has arrived in town, Paletta will risk everything for a night with the desired concubine, even stealing from a holy shrine that is under the protection of a local Mafia boss. The dead man’s mother anxiously awaits the arrival of Fefe, her son’s lover. He’s late because he’s afraid to meet Bastiano, the violent brother of the deceased. When Fefe finally arrives, he manages to avoid the wrath of Bastiano. Late at night, he steals a valuable ring of his dead lover’s hand, but he will not be able to enjoy the stolen goods for long. In the third story, the vicious Mafia boss Don Toto dissolves Lazarus, a loser who has refused to cooperate, in a bath of acid. Meanwhile, another Toto, an old Messiah, walks the crime infested streets, accompanied by the hunchbacked Judas. The family of the deceased Lazarus is able to convince Toto to try the miracle of resurrection. The Messiah surprisingly succeeds and Lazarus, returned to life, escapes to take his revenge...
Is it a satire, is it blasphemy, is it hilarious ! ? Yes, yes and yes, Toto Who Lived Twice is the second long feature film of the notorious duo Daniele Cipri and Franco Maresco. These two full blooded Sicilians first started collaborating together in 1986 on various short films and experimental Tv-programs. In 1992 they created the satirical Tv program Blob “Cinico Tv” for Rai3. It became very popular in Italy and was awarded with the Aristofane Award in Saint-Vincent. Their first long feature film, Lo Zio di Brooklyn, saw the light in 1996 and was a hit at various international film festivals like Berlin, Espoo, Tokyo and Jerusalem. Their latest, Toto Who Lived Twice, proved to be so controversial that it was banned from screening theatres in Italy. If you want to find out for yourselves why Toto would even make Passolini blush, then you know where you have to be."

After an accident that almost kills Nick, they decide to change their ways. The couple takes some time out and visits Nora’s small hometown in Ireland, where they hope to sober up. On the way to Uncle Ferriter’s house, which was once Nora’s home, they stop at a local pub. One drink won’t hurt, they think. But back on the road, Nora loses control of the wheel and the car flips over. They are helped out of the vehicle by Alice, a pale teenager, who leads them to her uncle’s estate. Ferriter seems to be about 35 years old, but Nora knows that he must be at least 60. He’s also legally been declared blind, but that does not seem to affect his perception. He shows them a macabre discovery. In a local peat bog, he found a Druid mummy that was buried 2000 years ago. After hunting for clues for several years, he discovered the mummy was Niamh, a powerful witch. She knew that someday her children’s children would provide the key for her return. Ferriter is convinced that she wants a new body, because her will is still alive. What he doesn’t tell Nora is that she is the perfect vessel for the resurrection of the witch. Once Nora goes to sleep, she will merge with Niamh.
Trance is a modern gothic tale of ancient passions and bizarre family secrets. Its director, Michael Almereyda is one of the most versatile and original talents in American cinema. He has carved out a reputation for himself by making stunning films like Twister and Another Girl, Another Planet with a Fischer Price pixelvision toy camera. Trance explores the same dark side of life as his beautiful black & white vampire film Nadja, produced by David Lynch and starring Elina Löwensohn, Martin Donovan and Peter Fonda. But this new take on the classic mummy story also reflects humour and allegory. Promising and talented young actress Alison Elliott (The Spitfire Grill, Wyatt Earp, The Wings of the Dove) plays a double part as Nora/Niamh. Jared Harris (B Monkey, Dead Man, I Shot Andy Warholl), the son of the famous Irish actor Richard Harris, is Jim, Nora’s wryly patient husband. Acclaimed actor Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter, The Dead Zone, The Funeral) plays uncle Ferriter, the eccentric recluse and guardian of the family’s darkest secrets."

High on drugs they race down the highway, but they are not alone in the car. Cecilie, the Strand’s 9-year-old daughter is in the back seat.
Weekend starts as a tense, edgy kidnap drama, but initial perceptions are soon completely confounded by later-stage plot developments. The impulsive act of the protagonists develops into a nerve shattering drama of life and death where the wrong move can prove fatal. With Weekend, director Erik Gustavson (The Telegrahists) has made an intriguing tale of fate and coincidences. Camilla Strom Henriksen gives a strong and sexy performance as the damaged and vengeful TK. Kim Kolstad stars as Allan, who pretty much does what TK tells him to."

So it comes as no surprise if I tell you that the demon has escaped the prison in which he was cast at the end of the first movie. Once more, the Djinn wanders among us. Watch out, you might not want what you wish for.
Wishmaster II : Evil Never Dies is clearly of a better vintage than its predecessor, which - despite Wes Craven as producer - lightly disappointed horror fans. This time Jack Sholder has directed the adventures of the Djinn. Sholder has made movies such as Nightmare on Elm Street II : Freddy’s Revenge, the excellent The Hidden (at the festival in 1988) and 12:01, our Prize of the Audience 1994. Once again, Andrew Divoff (Air Force One, The Hunt for Red October, Another 48 Hours) plays the Wishmaster.

This bizarre film about aliens with a craving for human flesh, took four years to complete (they shot it in their spare time). It turned out to be a big hit and launched Peter Jackson’s directing career. In 1989 he made Meet the Feebles, not your average puppet-movie. In 1992 he surprised friend and foe with Braindead, probably the bloodiest film ever made. Although it won the Grand Prix d’Avoriaz and made Peter Jackson the number one horror-director, he completely changed styles with his next movie. The briljant psycho-drama Heavenly Creatures (1994) earned him an Academy Award nomination and a contract with Universal. For this big studio he directed The Frighteners in 1996. At the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Cinema he returned to New Zealand to direct the fake documentary Forgotten Silver, about a forgotten movie maverick who never existed. At the moment Peter Jackson is working on
the big screen adaptation of Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. We are really proud to present him as a guest of honour at our festival.

going around !
Brussels seems to have become the capital of Fantasy!
And as every respectable rumour, it’s based on real facts…
At the arrival of March the city of Brussels – for the 17th time already – adorns itself in the colours of the festival (red & black). This year, the Festival is expanding once more. The centre remains the Passage 44, of course, but it will also take place at Cinema Nova, at the Halles de Schaerbeek, at the KultuurKaffee of the VUB, at the Belgian Centre of the Comic-Strip, at the Old Ice cellars of Brussels, at the Media Library of the French Community, at the Maison du Livre, at the Gallery ""d'Enfer"" and at the Royal Belgian Film Museum.
Fantasy Brussels has always been more than just film. Besides some 130 films presented during 16 days, you will also be able to enjoy several exhibitions, the Vampire Ball, the Unusual Fashion Show, Theatre (at the Auditorium and at the Halles), Body Painting and Make-up contests, the Comic-Strip, Music, and - for the first time - literature with ""Imaginary '99"".
Fantasy in all its forms penetrates Brussels during the entire month of March (the Carpenter retrospective in the Royal Belgian Film Museum starts on the 4th of March.). But the Festival isn’t limited to Brussels. In the rest of the country, Nights of Fantasy Films will take place in Liège, Ostend, Namur, Antwerp, Ghent, La Louvière, Hasselt and Louvain. When we close our doors, the Cynénygma festival in Luxembourg will keep the fire burning from 26 March till 2 April.
Forget about rumours. we’re talking about solid facts here ! Isn’t the Brussels Fantasy Film Festival the centre of the European Federation of Fantasy Film Festivals, which consists of the festivals of Sitges (Spain), Porto (Portugal), Rome (Italy), Espoo (Finland), Lund (Sweden), Luxembourg, San Sebastian (Spain), Amsterdam (The Netherlands) and Brussels.
That’s enough introduction. What will be the guiding principle of this 17th edition ?
Well, dear friends of the festival, we are going to return to “the source”.
After all, more than the feast, the originality, the efficiency, the pragmatic approach and the performance, it is friendship that strikes out as the primary characteristic of the festival.
This friendship between us and you, the audience, enables us to promote film together with the distributors, the producers, the directors, the actors and the film professionals. This friendship enables us to use the best of our abilities, together with our sponsors and the official authorities. And it is this friendship that ties together our festival team and our numerous volunteers.
The Festival is a long history of trust and solidarity in a hopelessly complicated and materialistic world that constantly balances on the edge of chaos.
Have a great festival",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brussels, Friday 16 March 2001, 23h00 :
like every other second Friday of the Festival, a legion
of fantasy fans storms the stairs of the Auditorium to
participate in a delirious marathon of frights and
shivers, laughter and amazement, surprises and
discoveries. And as always at the end, the valiant
survivors are treated to a hearty, recuperating
breakfast.
But the Festival, being its magnanimous and generous
self, also offers hungry fantasy fans in other cities the
opportunity to a Night with their favourite genre.
They’ll be spoiled with an outstanding selection of
four films from our 2001 programme, accompanied, of
course, by the inevitable breakfast in the early
morning.
This year, four cities will be exposed to our special
BIFFF 2001 cocktail.

1999,event,"Workshop, 4th Workshop ""Brussels Fantastic""",,"4th Workshop ""Brussels Fantastic""","Stuart, Gordon",,,,"WORKSHOP
For the fourth time, the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy, Thriller and Science-Fiction Films organises a workshop for film students.
The concept behind this workshop is to let young film students benefit from the knowledge and experience of famous (or notorious) directors. Under their supervision, some 40 students of the Narafi and the RITS will pick up essential experience in the field by making a short film under the theme “Imaginary Brussels”. 
After Dick Maas, Freddie Francis and Lewis Gilbert, director Stuart Gordon and screenwriter Dennis Paoli enthusiastically took up the challenge. This year, the students will not only get guidance during the shooting, but also while conceiving the screenplay. For this purpose, a screenplay-weekend will be organised in the presence of both movie personalities. 
Stuart Gordon is a familiar face at the festival, which is no more than logical for a director who has found his vocation in the horror-genre. He made his debut with two frightening H.P. Lovecraft adaptations : “Re-Animator” and “From Beyond”. They were followed by “Dolls”, “Daughters of Darkness” and “Robojox”, a movie for kids. Gordon showed his love for fantasy with a remake of Roger Corman’s “The Pit and the Pendulum, an adaptation of the famous story by Edgar Allen Poe. In 1993, the festival presented his futuristic prison thriller “Fortress”, with Christophe Lambert. Three years later, we could enjoy his “Castle Freak” and in 1997 his science-fiction adventure “Space Truckers” was shown at the Passage 44. 
Dennis Paoli worked with Stuart Gordon from the early days on. He wrote the screenplay for Gordon’s debut “Re-Animator” and followed this up with “From Beyond” and “The Pit and the Pendulum”. The screenplays for “Fortress” and “Castle Freak” also flowed out of his typewriter.
So, this year the future filmmakers have a unique opportunity to learn the tricks of the trade from a well oiled team of director and writer.

1999,event,"Hommage, Hommage Raoul Ruiz",,Hommage Raoul Ruiz,,,,,"In 1973 Raoul Ruiz exchanges Chile for Paris, where his style suddenly turns towards fantasy. His films follow labyrinthine plot lines and inventively display a powerful feeling of displacement. For the viewer this results in feelings of disorientation, enhanced by Ruiz’s generous images and favoured by intelligent editing. Cinema Nova presents a small selection from the vast body of work that Ruiz has produced over the years : the enigmatic thriller The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting (1978), The Territory (1981, co-produced by Roger Corman ), Treasure Island (1985) and Fado majeur et mineur (1993).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their work is characterised by a politically-incorrect range of subject matter including rape, incest, suicide, solitude, boredom and madness. They both use a hyper-realistic narrative, employ meticulous cinematography and visual techniques originating from comic strips and political pamphlets. They explore the every-day misery and amplify it by using the large frame size of Cinemascope

1999,event,"Hommage, Hommage Dario Argento",,Hommage Dario Argento,,,,,"Cinema Nova pays homage to this significant Italian filmmaker and avatar of violent modern horror. With his first films in the seventies, which form the so-called ""animal trilogy"", The Bird With the Crystal Plumage (1969), The Cat O'Nine Tales (1970) and Four Flies on Grey Velvet (1971), he gave new fuel to the Giallo genre (a mix of murder mystery and horror). And in 1972, he produced a series of four films for television, La Porta sul Buio (unedited!). Artificial techniques are meaningfully combined with content in films that, disguised as detective thrillers, pose troubling questions of causality and cognition. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1999,event,"Hommage, Hommage Peter Jackson",,Hommage Peter Jackson,,,,,"This homage wants to remind us of the cult status Peter Jackson already enjoyed before the release of the critically acclaimed Heavenly Creatures. There is definitely a good deal of slapstick-type humour in Bad Taste (1987), that deals with an invasion of man-eating aliens threatening to overthrow a small town. Meet The Feebles (1989) is a very unusual puppet-movie aiming to shock; and “shock” is definitely a state of mind induced by this film. And Braindead (1992) features what has been termed “probably the goriest scene ever”: an army of flesh-eating zombies being reduced to a pile of bloody remains by an ordinary lawnmower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1999,event,"Retrospective, Splatter-Movies Retrospective",,Splatter-Movies Retrospective,,,,,"During the Festival several midnight screenings, so-called Gore or Splatter films will try to disrupt your peace of mind. One of the genre's most infamous figureheads, Jörg Buttgereit, will personally present the infamous Nekromantik 1 (1987). A title that leaves little to one's imagination, Nekromantik I is a piece of exploitation that requires an iron-lined stomach. Just as bold, but far more ironic, is the film Olaf Ittenbach will be presenting at our Festival. Premutos: the Fallen Angel (1997) is a comedy horror  flic which revels in dismemberment and blood.
If you are already disturbed by the German living death, I bet you cannot wait to see what their Italian colleagues are capable of. Check out Nightmare (1981, Aka Nightmares in a Damaged Brain) by Roman Scavolini, with special F/X by Tom Savini, and two films by Lucio Fulci, the incontestable grandmaster of spaghetti-horror. Zombie Flesh Eaters (1979) allows cannibalistic zombies to conquer New York in Technicolor and Cinemascope. And you’ll find every horror cliché in the book in The House by the Cemetery (1981), an irresistible piece of pulp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1927, suffragette Germaine Dulac caused a scandal with this surrealist film, based on a screenplay by Antonin Artaud. With dramatic camera-moves and by using unusual perspectives, she tried to express the frustrations and sexual fantasies of a young priest. Her goal was a form of “pure” cinema, liberated from the influences of literature and theatre, that tended towards more musically constructed films.
This had a lot of appeal to versatile musician and multi-instrumentalist Geert Waegeman (known from a.o. Cro Magnon and the collaboration with Anna Homler and Pavel Fatj). Especially for this occasion, he created a soundtrack for this silent movie that will be performed life.                   Un Chien Andalou
Luis Bunuel, producer-director of the film, wrote the screenplay together with Salvador Dali. Bunuel dreamt of a small cloud that cut through the moon and of a razor that slit through an eye. Dali dreamt of his hand filled with ants. While making the movie, every form of logic, recognition, association and continuity was barred. The result is an anti-clerical, anti-bourgeois and irrational manifesto. “We belong to a society at war with surrealism!”, stated Bunuel.  
The music of this silent movie is performed life by DJ Mad Mix Man Reemoh (director, video-maker, drummer and concept-dj Remo Perrotti). You can expect an impressive mix of drum'n'bass, break-beats, techno and classic contemporary music.
..& CIRCUSES.
Once again, the Festival strikes at the heart of the VUB KultuurKaffee. Be prepared to be taken on a journey through the history of some of our favourite movie genres, neatly wrapped in four original compilation programs. The action starts on Tuesday night, with a two hour special of the horror film, 100 Years of Horror. Your host Christopher Lee will initiate you into the secrets of the genre, guiding you through interviews with “monstres sacrés” of horror and bloodcurdling extracts from legendary classics. Afterwards, we’ll have a nice little get-together with the radioactive descendants of Behemoth and Leviathan in Godzilla & Other Movie Monsters. Next day, we’ll show A Century of Sci-Fi , a voyage aboard an intergalactic spaceship with as your captain Christopher Lee. We’ll travel back through time to the very beginnings of Science Fiction and back again to the future, beyond the boundaries of cinematic imagination. To conclude the night, we’ll dive into the world of Serie Noire, an exploration from the forties until the present in the realm of chain-smoking detectives who get caught again and again in the intrigues spun by luscious femmes fatales. Step by step, the dense knot of crime, corruption, lies and deceit will be untangled to you. 
In short, the ideal opportunity to quench your thirst for cinematic knowledge..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
