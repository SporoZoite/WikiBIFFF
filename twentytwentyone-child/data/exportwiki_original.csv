Blood Moon,blood-moon,25140,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Let’s go back to Colorado in 1887. The sky is dominated by a blood red moon. In a typical small town, a number of mysterious characters cross paths, among whom Calhoun (Shaun Dooley), a lone gunslinger. They are captured by a band of outlaws, but after a while they discover a bigger threat that might kill them all: a mythical beasts that only comes out when that pretty moon is red. It’s going to be a long night, with any hope of seeing daylight fading fast.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fans of the TV series Misfits are warned. Shaun Dooley is even more frightening on the big screen than as a probation worker. This horror-western was directed by none other than Jeremy Wooding, known for Magnificent Eleven and the hit series Peep show. He situates the story at the end of the Wild West and infuses it with supernatural powers. Just to be clear; this is not Cowboys &amp; Aliens, but a balanced mix between the best genre elements: The Good, the Bad and the Terrifying!</p>",draft,2015-02-23 13:05:42,4739,,hidden,,https://archives.bifff.net/?post_type=product&p=25140,https://archives.bifff.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bloodmoon_poster.jpg,,,simple,exclude-from-catalog|exclude-from-search,2015|movie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CNA,2|1|0,,English,3|1|0,,Anna Skellern|Corey Johnson|Rafaella Degruttola|Shaun Doolly,6|1|0,,,,,Méliès Competition,12|1|0,,UK,1|1|0,,Jeremy Wooding,5|1|0,,Jinga Films,10|1|0,,horror,0|1|0,,,,,Jeremy Wooding|Michael Vine,9|1|0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alan Wightman,7|1|0,,Toby Pitman,8|1|0,,Dutch|French,4|1|0,,2014,11|1|0,

They want to explore the urban legend of a psycho killer, Charlie, whose parents were murdered by a vengeful mob accusing the couple of terrible doings towards backpackers working the farm. It’s not long into the group’s trip when we’re introduced to Charlie. And he’s hell bent on continuing the family tradition and killing the intruders in the most violent ways imaginable.

Danny's Doomsday,dannys-doomsday,25169,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A disaster of apocalyptical proportions strikes during a relentless heatwave. Danny and his younger brother William have not always been able to get along. They live in a quiet little town where nothing ever happens until the day that climate change leads to the impossible. Deadly monsters crawl out of the ocean and start killing everyone. Danny and William find shelter in their basement, without knowing the fate of their parents or friends. Tension is tight like a knife and William uses the moment to lash out against Danny for having never stood up for him all these times that he got bullied at school. Will the brothers repair their damaged relation and survive the end of the world?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Host meets An Inconvenient Truth. Scandinavia also seems to have a knack at turning out teen oriented genre flicks. Remember Tomas Alfredson’s brilliant Let The Right One In (Golden Raven BIFFF 2009), partly a coming of age drama, partly a vampire movie. Danny’s Doomsday hails from Denmark and is a solid addition to this ever more popular subgenre.</p>

He’s giving instructions to his elder brother, who tries to defeat underground kingpin Sal-soo on the Go board. But the gangsters, who are also cheating, are on to them and Tae-sok has to witness his brother getting killed. Sal-soo pins the murder on him, which gets him sent away behind bars for seven years.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Go is an extremely popular strategic game in Asia, with world championships and televised matches drawing crowds of millions. It has an especially huge following in Korea. So it’s no wonder that it proved fertile ground for a hard hitting thriller dealing with gambling, murder, revenge, martial arts and Go itself. Director Beom-gu Cho has turned the game into a life and dead struggle of brawn and brains, starring Woo-sung Jung (The Good, The Bad, The Weird, Reign of Assassins) as Ta-seok.</p>

Editor (The),editor-the,25209,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Imagine you’re the editor of an Italian giallo movie in the eighties and real murders, accompanied by weird bloody somethings, are taking place on the set. The Canadian The Editor not only gives us a fascinating insight on the set of a typical giallo – almost like the making of an imaginary movie – it’s also a loving homage to this terrific and typically Italian genre.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Let’s recapitulate. Giallo’s are mysterious murder tales in which the suspense of a Hitchcock movie is combined with gruesome body horror. Gialli are known for their flamboyant and experimental scripts, strange visuals, strongly elaborated production design, bold use of colors and lots of attention to music and atmosphere. The holy trinity of giallo directors consists of Dario Argento, Mario Bava and Lucio Fulci. The term giallo, Italian for yellow, refers to the color of the cover of the novels that inspired the gialli. Recently the genre has gathered some new international attention with Belgian directors Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani’s Amer and The Strange Color of Your Body’s Tears. The Editor, in its own fantastic, absurd and overwhelming way, contributes to the revival of this playful and unique genre.</p>",draft,2015-02-23 15:06:42,4739,,hidden,,https://archives.bifff.net/?post_type=product&p=25209,https://archives.bifff.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/theeditor_poster.jpg,,,simple,exclude-from-catalog|exclude-from-search|outofstock,2015|movie,,,Facultatif,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CNA,2|1|0,,English,3|1|0,,Adam Brooks|Laurence R.

The cat and mouse game can start and there can be only one survivor.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you wanted to describe the atmosphere of Extraterrestrial, you could say it’s a combination of the themes from Signs and Steven Spielberg’s War Of the Worlds, mixed with the tension of a David-Fincher-on-acid. This sci-fi slasher gives a crash-course of what people are going through when they’re picked up by those “friendly” lights in the sky. Extraterrestrial is the latest directorial effort from the Vicious Brothers. They made their mark with Grave Encounters, a true antidote to any Paranormal Activity related franchises.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes, it’s true. Taiwanese director Joey Chien has a subscription to the BIFFF. After Zombie 108 (2013) and The Apostles (2014), he’s back with Zombie Fight Club. This is no horror homage to David Fincher’s cult classic Fight Club, but more something like The Raid meets Resident Evil meets Highschool of the Dead. Do not expect lots of dialogue and a complicated plot. Tons of gore, scantily clad zombies and meat mincers as weapons are Zombie Fight Club’s forte. If you’re into yummy contemporary B-movies, get ready for a feast of limbs and intestines, starring Michael Wong (Transformers: Age of Extinction), Philip Ng (New Police Story) and Terence Yin (Lara Croft 2). You couldn’t wish for a better club!</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Korean action thriller The Terror Live takes place entirely in a radio studio and ingeniously uses this closed location to pump up tension and suspense from the very beginning to the spectacular end. The movie also has a solid backbone, lashing out against the merciless hierarchy and tough working conditions in Korean companies, the ruthless drive for higher ratings and the corruption and cronyism plaguing the higher layers of society. Korean superstar Jung-woo Ha (The Chaser, The Yellow Sea) plays the opportunist anchorman who gets caught in his own game.</p>

Greatful Dead,greatful-dead,25313,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nami is a very independent young girl who has survived her rough and loveless childhood by developing a bizarre hobby: the observation of solitary old people. During one of her spying sessions, she becomes fascinated by an old and very grumpy porn addict. Unfortunately for Nami, he doesn’t stay lonesome and unbearable for long. The man finds solace and joy in a religious community. Once again he walks around happily, reconnects with his family and makes new friends. But Nami is not about to let that go on for long.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The best description for Greatful Dead would be a new version of Takashi Miike’s The Audition. It starts as a bizarre Japanese comedy, but then becomes ever more dark and obscene. If you like your humor weird, love to discuss social problems and like to see cute girls completely loose it, then Greatful Dead might be something for you. Brace yourself for a horrific dramedy that will make you squirm in your seat, starring Itsuji Itao (Tokyo Gore Police) and Hôka Kinoshita (Ichi The Killer).</p>

This is never easy for the families, who are often left broken with grief. The Peterson’s are having a hard time coping with the death of their eldest son. Luckily there are still some good people in this world. A certain David comes knocking at their door. He says that he was a good friend of Caleb, having been there when he died. The Petersons are comforted by David’s visit and ask him to stay for a few days. But is David really the polite and friendly soldier he claims to be? His heart might be in the right place, but the way he acts is certainly unusual: beating up the entire soccer team for having bullied Caleb’s younger brother, dealing drugs at a party of younger sister Anna… What else does this unusual guest has in store for his new family?</p>

Honeymoon,honeymoon,25349,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Jorge couldn’t be happier. He’s met the love of his life; Isabelle. Everything happened so fast. Just four days ago, they were driving in Jorge’s car, with him behind the wheel and she resting in the trunk, the perfume of chloroform still clinging to her. Since then, Isabelle hasn’t left the cellar, which serves as their honeymoon suite. And it has to be said that she still needs some convincing this fairytale is real. Jorge tries real hard. He clips her nails (or rather tears them off), he (force)feeds her… Jorge still needs to come to grips with the concept of love, because he’s not creating a loving wife, but a monster thirsting for vengeance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Honeymoon, the latest film from Mexican director Diego Cohen, was awarded with the Bloody Work in Progress Award at the recent Blood Window Festival in Argentina.

Thirty years later she gets released and immediately starts to investigate what really happened. Belief, fate and the notion of time get mixed up in a mysterious, intangible puzzle. You’ll be at the edge of our seats, watching each plot change with awe and fascination.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Halleluja! A new master of horror suspense has risen and he hails from Venezuela. Alejandro Hiodalgo’s The House At The End Of Time was a big hit in his native country and you’ll soon find out why. What’s in store for us is almost a transcendental experience. Hidalgo, inspired by the classic haunted house movies, shows a Lovecraftian virtuosity for psychedelic suspense. And by playing with time, he adds an extra exciting dimension. It won’t be long before Hollywood snatches up the remake rights!</p>

III,iii,25375,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The two sisters Ayia and Mirra live in a godforsaken village in a remote corner of Mother Russia. The village is quickly losing its inhabitants, not because of the temptations of the big cities, but due to a mysterious and horrible disease that is lethal to everyone. Afraid of contagion, the authorities hermitically shut off the village from the outside world. During this time of complete isolation, Mirra contracts the disease and becomes completely psychotic. To save her sister, Ayia turns to the local priest, who is anything but orthodox. He initiates Mirra in shamanistic rituals and convinces her to penetrate Mirra’s subconscious to expel the demons that torture her.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you’re thinking you’re going to see a Russian version of Under The Dome, you’re completely wrong. III is more closely related to movies such as The Cell and Vanishing Waves, where the exploration of the dark corners of the subconscious and the battle between good and evil are central. III should also be praised for its stunning use of colors, depicting a world that looks like a post-apocalyptic version of a Hieronymus Bosch painting.</p>",draft,2015-02-23 17:11:21,4739,,hidden,,https://archives.bifff.net/?post_type=product&p=25375,https://archives.bifff.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/III_officialposter.jpg,,,simple,exclude-from-catalog|exclude-from-search,2015|movie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CNA,3|1|0,,Russian,4|1|0,,Evgeny Gagarin|Lubov Ignatushko|Polina Davidova,7|1|0,,,,,7th Orbit Competition,1|1|0,,Germany|Russia,2|1|0,,Pavel Khvaleev,6|1|0,,One Eyed Films,11|1|0,,horror|supernatural|surreal,0|1|0,,,,,Frank Ellrich,10|1|0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alexandra Khvaleeva,8|1|0,,Loolacoma|Moonbeam,9|1|0,,Dutch|English|French,5|1|0,,2014,12|1|0,
Incident (The),incident-the,25388,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The incident in question is one of the spatial-temporal kind. Two smalltime crooks are being chased by a cop on a stairwell without end. Every day they wake up in the same place where the end is also the beginning. All material objects, beer, cigarettes, snacks… are regenerated at the same spot. Only their bodies are ravaged by time. The trio’s fate is shared by a family who cannot seem to escape from the country road on which they’re driving. Thirty years go by and they’ve given up all hope of escape. Then both groups hear the same explosion and a body turns up.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ingmar Bergman once said about his legendary cult classic The Seventh Seal: 'I wrote this film to conjure up my own fear of dying'. We think than Mexican director Isaac Ezban has also made The Incident to stave off his fear from death. Philip K. Dick’s universe is never far away, but Ezban also uses contemporary pop culture references, while the way he wraps up things at the end is both memorable and profound.</p>

Infinite Man (The),infinite-man-the,25401,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dean, a not very successful and anxious scientist, prepares to celebrate his first kiss with his girlfriend Lana. Being a control freak, he manically recreates the same date as the year before. The same hotel, the same clothes, the same hour… At 13.54 they drink a glass of Champaign. At 14.02 their lips touch for the first time and at 14.08 it’s time for making whoopee. Everything should run perfectly to plan, but it’s exactly the opposite that takes place. The hotel looks more like a set from Mad Max 4 than a romantic dating spot. Lana is less than pleased with the proceedings and when her cocksure athletic previous beau shows up with a package of condoms and the conviction to use them all, he even gets away with it… and with Dean’s girl. There’s only one thing he can do: build a time travel machine to save his relationship. But messing with time is never without risk. Dean opens doors out of which several versions of himself pop up. Sometimes they’re alone, sometimes there are more of them, they try to steal Lana from Dean nr.1 or go for something completely else. We can only hope that something beautiful will grow out of this temporal chaos.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Aussie director Hugh Sullivan has taken a bold and ambitious risk with his feature film debut. Time travel movies are legion and they are often too frail or too complex (remember Primer!). Luckily for us, Sullivan has created a strong new addition to the genre. Dean’s temporal tomfoolery can even be compared to the ordeals of Bill Murray in Groundhog Day or Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.</p>",draft,2015-02-23 17:31:22,4739,,hidden,,https://archives.bifff.net/?post_type=product&p=25401,https://archives.bifff.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/theinfiniteman_officialposter.jpg,,,simple,exclude-from-catalog|exclude-from-search,2015|movie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CNA,3|1|0,,English,4|1|0,,Alex Dimitriades|Hannah Marshall|Josh McConville,7|1|0,,,,,International Competition,1|1|0,,Australia,2|1|0,,Hugh Sullivan,6|1|0,,Shoreline Ent.,11|1|0,,black comedy|time travel,0|1|0,,,,,Kate Croser|Sandy Cameron,10|1|0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hugh Sullivan,8|1|0,,Jed Palmer|Zoe Barry,9|1|0,,Dutch|French,5|1|0,,2014,12|1|0,

Ambrose McKinley, a blind Vietnam vet, and his loyal dog Shadow are the newest residents of Crescent Bay, a squeaky clean and sterile community for the elderly. The lawns are cut to perfection; you could eat of the ground, grannies gang up on Sundays to bake muffins… It’s a perfect little waiting room for the soon to be deceased. But Ambrose misses the action. Luckily there are rumors about a wild lynx on the premises that make the hearts and pacemakers of the residents beat faster. One evening Ambrose stumbles upon the leftovers from the latest meal of the so-called lynx. They’re the remains of an old lady and of his only friend in the world; Shadow. The police do not believe his story because a blind man is not actually a very reliable source of information. Ambrose’s mind is made up.

Lost Soul - The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau,lostsoul,25460,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After the success of Hardware and Dust Devil, Richard Stanley gets the chance to realize his dream project; an adaptation of H.G. Wells’ classic The Island Of Dr Moreau. He hopes to direct a very personal, eccentric and daring movie. Unfortunately it’s impossible to make something like that in Hollywood without dancing with the devil. The shooting is a hellish ordeal. Stanley faces censorship, a storm destroys the set and the colossal egos of Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer crash with each other. Stanley gets replaced by John Frankenheimer, someone who’s more pliable to the wishes of the studio execs, and is banned from the set. Disguised as one of Dr. Moreau’s creatures, he infiltrates the shooting and is a first row witness of how his dream falls apart.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lost Soul is a documentary about a movie that never was, at least not the way its director intended it to be. Like previous movies about the same subject (Lost in La Mancha, Jodorowsky’s Dune), this is a film about a director who goes through big studio hell. As often, it’s the story of one man against the machine. Lost Soul is a fascinating and riveting tale about a modern day Don Quixote.</p>",draft,2015-02-24 09:47:21,4739,,hidden,,https://archives.bifff.net/?post_type=product&p=25460,https://archives.bifff.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/lostsoul_poster.jpg,,,simple,exclude-from-catalog|exclude-from-search,2015|movie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CNA,2|1|0,,English,3|1|0,,Fairuza Balk|Richard Stanley|Rob Morrow|Robert Shaye,6|1|0,,,,,,,,UK|USA,1|1|0,,David Gregory,5|1|0,,Severin Films,10|1|0,,documentary,0|1|0,,,,,David Gregory,9|1|0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mark Raskin,8|1|0,,Dutch|French,4|1|0,,2015,11|1|0,

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this Japanese hybrid of Ocean Eleven and The Italian Job, our favorite “best thief in the world” ends up in a series of highly sophisticated thefts, intricate conspiracies and dazzling slapstick spectaculars. Lupin will have to find his way into the most secured vault on the planet to steal ""Cleopatra’s Heart"". What follows is a breathtaking adventure that perfectly captures the tone, atmosphere and spirit of Lupin.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It took two years to write the script. Shooting took place in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand. Director Ryuhei Kitamura (Versus, Aragami, The Midnight Meat Train) has transferred the live-action adventures of Lupin to a contemporary setting. That’s quite a feat for the grandson of Arsène Lupin, whose first appearance was in the Monkey Punch manga’s at the end of the sixties. Since then, he has become an essential anime stalwart.</p>

Mexico Barbaro,mexico-barbaro,25465,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One short plunges headlong in the violence the Aztecs were notorious for. Another one pays homage to a Mexican horror legend. The third one mixes child kidnapping with illegal organ trafficking. Some films are grounded in fantasy, other are grounded in grim reality. There’s a parody on American horror cinema. One has pitch perfect production design, another is pure grindcore. In short, this is one heartily stuffed bloody burrito we’d love to bite in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The title of this horror anthology is a perfect declaration of intention. One hundred years after H. Wood’s eponymous movie, upcoming directors of contemporary Mexican cinema present us with a series of shorts that each highlight another cruel aspect of the Latin-American country. The theme and tone of every contribution is always different, but the talent shown in this extreme, bizarre, surreal, absurd, grand guignolesque compilation is undeniable.</p>

Midnight After (The),midnight-after-the,25485,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hong Kong is not a small city. And with its seven million inhabitants, you can be sure that it’s a city that never sleeps. Crowded nightly escapades are part of the DNA of this megalopolis. But for 17 night bus passengers, their trip through Hong Kong turns into a surreal nightmare. They’re driving through a ghost town. The streets are completely deserted. There’s no sign of life anywhere to be seen. The wildest theories are popping up: Fukushima 2, everybody’s at home playing Farmville, it’s the end of the world and they forgot to tell us? Our passengers are having a massive freak out. And it gets worse when their cell phones all start to vibrate at the same time. At the other end of the line thousands of voices crying out for help…</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fruit Chan has already collaborated with some big names in horror and thriller. In 2005 we screened Three, Extremes, directed by Takashi Miike, Chan-wook Park… and Fruit Chan. The Midnight After is based on a popular manga and masterfully plays both horror and comedy nerves. We’re already labelling this movie as cult. Wanna bet you’ll agree with us after the screening?</p>

Target (The),target-the,25495,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After eight years of study, sleepless nights, countless cramming sessions and a work schedule of 25 hours per day, you might think new ER doctor Tae-Jun deserves some rest. Unfortunately he had to spend the entire night operating on a special patient. A few hours after the surgery, the hospital is swarming with cops. The guy must probably be a highly dangerous criminal. Before Tae-Jun has the chance to close his eyes, he gets an anonymous phone call. If he doesn’t help his patient to escape, his highly pregnant wife will pay the price. That’s not going to be easy, with all those cops on one side and a squad of hired killers having penetrated the hospital to kill his new protégée on the other side!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you’ve enjoyed adrenaline induced chase movies with lots of plot twists such as Enemy of The State and The Fugitive, you’re going to love The Target. This Korean remake of the French box office hit Point Blank from 2010 was also a huge popular success thanks to an ironclad script and dazzling martial-arts action. After 2009’s Deathbell, director Chang returns to the BIFFF with a new action extravaganza.</p>

Then he gets a skype call by a certain Chord, who tells him that the superstar won’t be able to make it, but that he gets the chance to follow her through the webcam on her pc, her cell phone camera and all the other electronic devices that register every second of Jill’s life. A dream come true for Nick, but he doesn’t realize that he’s being set up as the fall guy for an attempted murder on his beloved actress.

Her obsessed fan is none other than Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings, Maniac, Cooties), who’s already proven that he can play a loser in the underrated series Wilfred.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Everybody cheered when hearing that the successful adaptation of Rurouni Kenshin from 2012 would get two sequels. This success is based on the cult status of the comic that inspired the movies. Rurouni Kenshin is the tale of Himura Kenshin, a former sword for hire who wants to forget his past by assisting those in need. On his travels he encounters many people from his past, a few friends and a lot of enemies. Takeru Sato one again incarnates Kenshin, while his opponent is played by none other than Tatsuya Fujiwara, the hero from Battle Royale and the bad guy from Death Note and Monsterz.</p>

Sleeping Room (The),sleeping-room-the,25595,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Blue, an aptly named melancholic prostitute, wanders the streets of Brighton in search for clients. One day, one of them takes her to an old Victorian house. Before savoring her skills, the guy gives Blue a guided tour of the enormous mansion. He shows her an ancient projector containing strange images. Blue’s curiosity is tickled and, once the job’s done, she starts exploring the house for herself. In one of the rooms she discovers a secret chamber hid behind a huge mirror. Blue finds out that the house was used as a brothel in the 19th century. The owner, an avant-gardist with disgusting habits, was probably the director of the world’s first snuff movie. But that’s not everything. Blue is not alone in the secret chamber…</p>
The Sleeping Room is a very atmospheric picture with plenty of old-school gore that reminds you of the Hammer horror movies.

Shrew's Nest,shrews-nest,25614,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Spanish never shy away from a solid portion of baroque horror. No one less than BIFFF regular Alex de la Iglesia (El Día de Bestia, Balada Triste) produced this intense tale about two sisters who share an apartment in 1950ties Madrid. It could be a cozy affair, but big sis Montse suffers from anxiety attacks, doesn’t dare to leave the house and physically abuses her little sister.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But that’s just the start. When Montse is under the influence of morphine, she gets visits by their deceased father. And when the handsome upstairs neighbor makes her heart beat faster, she just ties him to her bed. This all results in some deliciously grim situations, because, as we know from Rec., when the Spanish are locked up, things tend to get completely out of hand.</p>

Rurouni Kenshin : The Legend Ends,rurouni-kenshin-the-legend-ends,25627,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Legend Ends is the final part of the trilogy that started in 2012 and gives the fans what they always loved in the Rurouni Kenshin series: long forgotten ancient fighting techniques and old masters. In this last chapter Kenshin will have to go all the way to stop Shishio’s plans to overthrow the Meiji government. He’ll meet some old friends and will find support from his master.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The success of this series is for a big part due to the action scenes. In a time where everything is created and enhanced by CGI, it’s a real joy to see actors performing some real fighting choreography. The Japanese movie critics were unanimous with their praise and the gods know how strict they are when it comes to live adaptations of this caliber. The Rurouni Kenshin series is one of the best manga adaptations of this time and doesn’t abandon its fans for a bigger audience. If you love manga, go see this movie. If you love action, go see this movie, if you love Kenshin, definitely go see this movie. And if you’re not dead, there’s really no reason not to go see this movie!</p>

Monsterz,monsterz,25713,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some people are born with a harelip, other with a birthmark, but this child was born with a demonic power that would give the Children of the Corn a run for their money. With his eyes he can control people’s minds and even drive them to suicide. This power makes him master of the world, robbing banks in seconds and killing everyone that stands in his way. Then, one day, he runs into Shuichi, who’s completely immune to his power. Luckily this anomaly seems to be short-lived, as Shuichi gets run over by a truck. Or is it? Because where there’s a Ying, there’s a Yang. Shuichi returns and he’s dead-set on stopping him once and for all.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Everybody who knows their J-Horror, will rejoice when hearing that Hideo Nakata has helmed this feature. The master of contemporary horror (Ringu, Dark Water…) mixes themes from his earliest work with that of his later films (Death Note, Chatroom). The bad guy is none other than Tatsuya Fujiwari (Battle Royale, Death Note), while his opponent is a part of Takayuki Yamada (13 Assassins, Gantz). You’d better brace yourselves, because after Monsterz, you’ll never look at the Grand Theatre of the BIFFF in the same way!</p>

Blue Elephant (The),blue-elephant-the,25790,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Five years after the death of his wife and daughter, psychiatrist Yehia thinks about stopping with treating the mentally ill. He drowns his grief in whisky and doesn’t bother to turn up at work. His boss wants to shake him out of his stupor and puts him to the choice: either stop completely or start working in prison with mentally disturbed heavy criminals. Yehia goes for the job and runs into a familiar face. Sherif was one of his best friends from high school and is suspected of having violently raped and murdered his wife. It is said he’s faking his illness to avoid the firing squad. But Yehia thinks it’s anything but normal that Sherif only speaks in riddles and mathematical formulas. He starts to dig deeper into the case.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It’s not every day that you get to see an Egyptian thriller with fantastic undertones. The Blue Elephant is a rock solid cinematic ride that, in very intelligent ways, breaks lots of taboos in the Arab word. Add to that the sumptuous imagery of director Marwan Hamed and the intense performance of the ravishing Nelly Karim, and you get a highly recommended viewing experience.</p>

Goodnight Mommy,goodnight-mommy,25791,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A mother returns from hospital with her head covered in bandages. She demands total silence from her two sons, who are identical twins. No sunlight is allowed into the house. Only one of the brothers may eat. The other one gets nothing. They’re not allowed to have contact with each other. Their house becomes a prison, a hospital, a breeding ground for madness and trauma.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There must be something strange in the Austrian air. They regularly produce chillingly frightening art-house movies that take you on a demonic sightseeing trip through the vile sewers of the human soul. Everybody knows Michael Haneke’s vicious dissections of humanity. But there’s also Michaël by Markus Shleinzer, who exposed us to the inner world of a pedophile. And the movies of Ulrich Seidl (Dog Days, Import/Export, the Paradise trilogy) always take you to places you’ve never wanted to go to. All these movies show a kind of horror that can’t be laughed away, that profoundly disturbs and confronts because it is rooted in grim reality. Goodnight Mommy, by Severin Fiala en Veronika Franz (who happens to be the co-writer of Ulrich Seidl’s films) is a brilliant addition to these ""horrors of the human psyche"" tradition.</p>

But Mini gets caught and sentenced to a lifetime of hard labour. Miranda, who feels guilty, tries to help him escape. But will they succeed?</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Dead Lands gives a truly unique and (lucky for us) deliciously violent look on Maori culture long before Captain Cook started to put his meddlesome big nose in the affairs of the fiercely tattooed warriors from what was to become New Zealand.

Robot Overlords,robot-overlords,25828,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It took only a few days for the alien robots to conquer Earth. There’s only one rule. Stay inside or be disintegrated. Where they come from, their reasons for invading and keeping people locked inside are completely unknown. They use human collaborators and deliver food rations at home, but their most powerful tool of control is the implant that everyone has and with which they can track your every move. In a small coastal town in England, four children discover a way to temporarily disable the implants. They’re finally able to go outside again. Maybe they’ll even get to start a rebellion against the Robot Overlords!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Director Jon Wright, to whom we thank Grabbers (BIFFF 2012), has crafted an intense scifi adventure movie for the entire family. Its budget might only been a fraction of that of a Transformers movie, but unlike that giant franchise, it treats its audience with respect and invites them to join in the fun. The four young leads steal the show, getting some big name support from Sir Ben Kingsley (Sexy Beast, iron Man 3) as a villainous robot collaborator and Gillian Anderson (X-Files, The Fall) as their worried mum.</p>

Born to Die,born-to-die,26179,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is not an adaptation of a Lana Del Rey album, but both contain very spicy subject matter. Almost all the employees of a spicy sauce factory are slaughtered. Responsible for this drama: hitman Victor Patibulo, notorious for sucking on a pacifier ever since his favorite poodle got killed. One body is absent among the dead: big boss Heraclito, who had just created a revolutionary new sauce. Is there a connection? There’s only one man who’ll be able to find out: the handsome, strong and clever Marcello Risk, star of the anti-terrorism unit K.K.D.B.B. Together with his sidekick, Guadalajara Man, big fan of martial arts and bananas, he’ll try to solve the mystery. But there are many weird and wonderful enemies on their path, their boss is mind-bogglingly dumb and their residential science genius hasn’t eaten in weeks. Cutbacks, you know!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Born to Die does not only sound insane, it actually is quite insane! This unofficial sequel to Bailando con el Peligro (Dancing with Danger) doesn’t take itself serious for one second.
