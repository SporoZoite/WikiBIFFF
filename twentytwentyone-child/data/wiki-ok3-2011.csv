the battle against Franco’s troops. The Republican
army forces the artists of a touring circus to help
them fend off an attack. In the ensuing fight, one of the
clowns distinguishes himself by cutting down dozens
of fascists with a machete. After the war, he ends up in
a forced labor camp. He tells his son Javier that he will
only know love by taking revenge. When Javier follows
his advice and bombards the camp, his father dies
and the camp commander gets mutilated, which gives
Javier an enemy for life. 1973, Javier is a sad, obese
clown, working in a circus run by the sadistic Sergio.
When both fall in love with the beautiful trapeze artist
Natalia, a rapidly escalating orgy of violence ensues, in
which Javier will come face to face with his past.
Alex De La Iglesia ( The Day of the Beast, Commonwealth,
The Oxford Murders ) is in terrific shape. He
comes to the BIFFF with his magnum opus. A Sad
Trumped Ballad is not only a cinematographical tourde-
force, with numerous unforgettable scenes; it also
contains some very significant symbolism. With Javier
the republican, Sergio the fascist and Natalia as lady
Spain herself, you have two
sides fighting for the soul of
a country and hereby causing
irreparable damage. The result
is as highly entertaining as
it is sobering. De La Iglesia
wraps his angry fist
in layers of black humor,
but this will not stop A
Sad Trumpet Ballad from
knocking you out."

years ago the Earth received some unexpected
visitors. The aliens were finally pushed back and contained.
The infected zone, closed off by enormous fences,
now covers the entire border region between the US
and Mexico. Photographer Andrew is ordered by the big
boss to get his daughter Samantha out of Mexico, which
is still ravaged by the invasion. When they miss the last
boat to the States, Andrew and Samantha have to fork
out their remaining dollars and buy passage through
the zone along with a few hired guides. The two grow
closer and closer on their dangerous journey through
this strange and mysterious area.
Director-scriptwriter Gareth Edwards wanted to start
his long feature debut where most alien invasion
movies end. The look of Monsters is incredibly detailed.
It looks like a big budget spectacle, but is actually
a small independent production, where all visual
effects were created on Edwards’ laptop. Just like
in any other good genre pic, it’s not about monsters
but about the relation between the two leads, played
by talented newcomers Scott McNairy and Whitney
Able, and the unique, unusual
situation in which they find
themselves. Monsters is proof
again that you don’t need
heaps of money to create
a completely original

thwarts all genre conventions."

in a run down hotel. They soon sense that something is
not right about the place. A little girl and her dog are

Then people start disappearing and soon there are only

murderous past of the hotel, but the owner refuses to
give anything away. If the remaining friends won’t find
some answers soon, they all risk to exchange the world
of the living for the world of the dead.
When the Pang brothers ( Bangkok Dangerous, Re-

title, you know what you’re going to get : hair-raising
tension, accompanied by unhealthy portions of audio
and visual shock effects. The Child’s Eye does not surpass
their groundbreaking The Eye ( Bifff 2003 ) or the
same-named Hollywood remake ( Bifff 2008 ), but it will
guarantee solid Asian ghost horror fun. With some fine
young talent from Hong Kong in

Wu’s beloved protégé Jing’er, the impulsive albino justice

Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame
marks a return to form for the legendary Hong Kong action
director and producer Tsui Hark ( Zu Warriors, Once

mix of supernatural mystery, historical pulp, dazzling
fighting scenes and fantasy, all wrapped up in a breathtaking
cinematic adventure of two hours. Inventive and
impressive production design and the cream of the crop
of the Hong Kong acting guild – Andy Lau ( Infernal Affairs,

Ji-woon Kim is back with a film that has already made
many viewers around the world very uncomfortable.
Needless to say, Asian extreme movie standards are
pretty high, but I Saw the Devil has gone one step

a breath of fresh blood in the worn out vampire genre.
It’s a gritty, very realistic and claustrophobic viewing

Legendary filmmaker Jerzy Skolimowski, who – let’s
be chauvinistic for once – won the Golden Bear at the
Berlin Film Festival for the Belgian shot The Departure
( 1967 ), is far from self-indulgent when it comes
to his work. But with Essential Killing, he is in no
doubt : it’s his best film ! Intentionally vague on the
main character ( a civilian caught in the wrong place
at the wrong moment or a fierce Taliban fighter ? ),
Skolimowski’s main point is more about a struggle of
a man against the wilderness than a political metaphor.
From this perspective, he has also skipped
superfluous dialogue and the names of the protagonists,
apart from the two main characters ( Vincent
Gallo and Emmanuelle Seigner – who happens to be
the wife of his fellow countryman Roman Polanski ! ).
At the 2010 Venice Film Festival, Essential Killing won
the best actor award for Vincent Gallo and the Special

a life which feels familiar but somehow strange to her.
Her home has been turned into a clinic and her family
have disappeared! After stumbling into a series of bewildering
incidents, she comes to the conclusion that,
just like Alice in Wonderland, she has landed in a fantasy
world, where only an old and lonely failed businessman
will talk to her. Moreover, the old man takes her home to
keep her warm and looks after her with love and care.
In Ayu’s dream, neither time nor space feels coherent.
Nothing in this world seems connected with reality. It
has such a strange impact on Ayu that she begins to
behave bizarrely: she goes to the bathroom but forgets
to have a shower; she gets lost while chasing after an
imaginary figure; she can’t remember the things she
has done and she falsely accuses their maid of stealing.
The old man tolerates all of this erratic behaviour, but
still having no one to share his burden, he is becoming
overwhelmed by feelings of desperation. Ayu feels
the distant memories hidden inside her and tries every
means of retrieving them.

crisis since his father died. He watches
the world around him and notices a slight smell of the
apocalypse. His fellow men seem to be bored stiff and
pass the time by organizing nihilistic orgies or by metaphysically
giving the same importance to questions like
e.g.“Give me some salt” and “Who am I ?” So Tony takes
stock of the values that govern his life and tries to find
a satisfying answer in seven chapters, which just happens
to be the the same number as the Deadly Sins or
the circles in Dante’s Inferno. From religious decay over
the illusion of love to the erosion of social intercourse,
Tony will slowly but surely reach the conclusion that life
is useless. Tony will have to face some very unpleasant
answers in order to survive. Who am I ? A loser. Where
am I ? In deep shit. Where am I going ? Straight against
the wall, Tony. Straight against the wall…
This poetic requiem – the Estonian candidate at this
year’s Oscars – confirms Veikko Ounpuu’s talent, director
of the award winning Autumn Ball. Inspired by Dante’s
Divine Comedy and Hieronymus Bosch’s The Temptation
of St Anthony, “St Tony” also salutes the movies of Roy
Andersson, with its dry sense of
humour, sweats Kafkaesque
absurdity from each frame, and
takes its metaphysical surrealism
straight from Tarkovsky
and Bunuel. The Temptation
of St. Tony is heavy
but very enjoyable stuff
without a shred of indigestible
pretentiousness."

northern half of Japan, transforming those who
inhale it into ravenous, flesh-eating zombies hell-bent
on devouring the surviving human population. Plunged
into chaos, Japan is torn in two – the southern half of the
country, where the populace remains untouched by the
deadly gas, lives behind a heavily-fortified wall, while the
northern half is a lawless, zombie-infected wasteland.
Political forces are locked in a stalemate over whether the
living dead should remain protected as family members
or exterminated like a plague. The economy withers away,
and all hope seems lost for the people and the nation of
Japan. Hope arrives in the form of Kika, a beautiful high
school girl armed with a chainsaw sword powered by an
artificial heart. Recruited by the government, Kika leads
a ragtag group of desperados on a secret mission into
the zombie-infected wilds to exterminate zombie queen
Rikka and put an end to the plague of the living dead. But
the road is fraught with a thriving zombie culture that,
with its own designs on the living half of Japan, refuses
to lay down and die.
Anybody who’s familiar with the movies of special effects
wizard and splatter godfather Yoshihiro Nishimura, will
not be surprised when we say that the above synopsis is
merely the beginning of the movie. Nishimura astounded
everybody in 2008 with Tokyo Gore Police and is almost
solely responsible for all the bloody sfx mayhem in the
genre (Machine Girl, Robogeisha, Hard Revenge Millie…).
Last year, we had a bloody good riot with Vampire Girl
vs Frankenstein Girl. But this year Nishimura himself will
introduce us to his most ambitious project to date. Helldriver
is a non-stop splatter opera, a true endurance test
for the senses, with record breaking quantities of blood,
flying limbs and legions of zombies."

Bill Compton, a handsome, two-hundred year old vampire

group of survivors, traveling across the desolate United
States in search of a new home away from the shuffling
hordes of the undead. The group is led by Rick Grimes,
who was a sheriff’s deputy in a small Georgia town before
the zombie outbreak. As their situation grows more
precarious, the group’s desperation to survive pushes
them to the brink of insanity. At every turn they are faced
with the unspeakable horrors that come from having
the dead walk again, as well as facing hostility from the
scattered remains of a struggling human populace who
are focused on their own survival, now that the structures
of society have collapsed.
When rumors were confirmed that director Frank Darabont
( The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The
Mist ) was working with producer Gale Anne Hurd ( The
Terminator movies ) on an television adaptation of the
bestselling zombie comics by Robert Kirkman, the series
soon became one of the most anticipated shows in
TV history. And you will not be disappointed. The first
season of The Walking Dead was hailed by critics not as
one of the best horror series in recent years but simply
as one of the best TV series in recent years, period !
Darabont has captured Kirkman’s oppressive world in
breathtaking detail and with a cinematic and emotional
scope that far exceeds the little screen. Now the Bifff, in
collaboration with BeTv, will give you an exclusive preview
by screening the pilot episode of season one. Do
not miss this unique opportunity !"

runs through the woods, with the police hot on
her heels. She manages to reach an abandoned farmhouse,
which she promptly torches before the cops
can arrest her. She wakes up in a psychiatric hospital
without any memories of how she got there. Kristen is
put under the care of Dr. Stringer, who places her with
a group of four other traumatized girls and subjects
them to a new kind of therapy. Of course they’re supposed
to get better, but the thing is that no one has
ever left the ward; at least not officially, because many
former residents simply vanished without a trace.
The Ward is Master of Horror John Carpenter’s first
feature since 2001’s Ghosts of Mars and it looks like
the director of Halloween, The Thing and Escape From
New York is still capable of delivering the goods. It
even feels like a relief to see an atmospheric horror
flic of the kind they used to make in the 70ties, but
provided with top notch contemporary camerawork
and sound design. And Carpenter demonstrates that
he can still use his considerable arsenal of horror
and shock effects to maximum effect. With scream

Angry ) as Kristen and Jared

she had befriended a girl named Bok-nam, who still writes
to Hae-won asking her to visit despite the fact that Hae-won

all the men and a free labourer for the women. Sick of all
this inhumane treatment, Bok-nam has tried to escape the
island several times in the past, but failed. She begs Haewon
to help her get away, but Hae-won remains indifferent,
not wanting to get involved in complicated situations. When
Bok-nam realizes that her own daughter will end up like her,
she tries to flee the island with her, but her daughter gets
killed in the process. And having lost the only thing that had
kept her going due to Hae-won’s negligence, Bok-nam takes
a sickle in her hand for her revenge.
The first long feature from Jang Cheol-soo, Kim Ki-duk’s

2011,edition,"Edito, Edito 2011",,Edito 2011,,,,,"ver since its appearance, the fantastic genre
has never ceased to look for inspiration in
myths and popular beliefs. From Jacques
Tourneur’s Cat People over Richard Fleischer’s
Soylent Green to Steven Spielberg’s Minority
Report, the large majority of these films had one
point in common: an extraordinary intervention
from outside.
This disruptive element could manifest itself in
various ways : aliens, zombies, a virus, monsters,
insects… Humanity’s entire bestiary went
through the fantastic mill !
Unfortunately, the well seems to have dried up. In
recent years, movie screens have been saturated
to the point of indigestion with remakes of the
classics. The icing on the cake might be different,
to the viewer it all tastes the same.
But while the mainstream was endlessly recycling
itself, the avant-garde of the fantastic genre understood
the necessity to change and to adapt.
And we can say that this mutation has been successful,
as the genre now enters a new era : the
age of introspection.
The selection of the 29th BIFFF is just bursting
with these new topics; where we are our own
worst enemy and where the extraordinary comes
from the inside. It’s as if we’ve discovered a goldmine
somewhere deep in the abysses of our grotesquely
underused brain.
Schizophrenia, deviant psychology, alienation…
In brief, all these pathologies of the mind that
used to play second fiddle, are now firmly taking
center stage.
While this trend is obvious, everybody has their
own way to translate this into images. The Asians
are torn between poetical modesty ( One Day,
Ayu ) and anarchical neurotic explosions ( Hell
Driver, Tetsuo ), while the Scandinavians leave
their legendary reserve in the closet to smash
their folklore into pieces ( Troll Hunter, Rare Exports
). But the biggest surprise this year comes
from Eastern Europe with hermetic features that
delve into the deepest recesses of our subconscious
( Strayed, The Temptation of St Tony ).
With such a menu, there’s no need to say that the
BIFFF has put a heavy load on its shoulders. How
will we be able to surpass this for our 30th anniversary
edition !? Does anybody know if there’s
still a place available on Dr. Melfi’s couch ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as a movie lover and
you might even be a
diehard genre fan, but to become
a genuine moviemaker, you’ll
undoubtedly need some training.
That’s why every year the Bifff
organizes its Workshop “Fantastic
Brussels”. This unique experience
allows students of two Brussels based film schools
( RITS and INSAS ) to direct two short movies under the
supervision of an experienced and renowned foreign
film director.
For this 16th edition, the big boss is Jake West, English
filmmaker with some heavy stuff on his CV : Razor
Blade Smile, Evil Aliens ( presented at the Bifff in
2006 ), and his latest, the anti macho zombie flick
Doghouse.
Practically speaking, the shooting took place on the
22nd, 23rd and 24th of March. The editing and the postproduction
went on from March 25th until March 30th.
And the official screening will, off course, take place at
the Bifff during its Belgian Fantastic Film Day !
And there are also some Prizes to be attributed. One
lucky student will receive the Eye-Lite
Award ( 2,500 € of lightning equipment
for a next project ). The Bifff will also
award some students with two prizes
for those who distinguished themselves
during the entire production process.
Let us seize the opportunity to warmly thank the Flemish

(Star Trek), a fleece of hairy ferret
or donuts in the hair ( Chewbacca
and Princess Leïa ), the
Japanese cosplay celebrates its
manga and videogame heroes.
A huge institution in the land
of the rising sun, this tribute
quickly caught on with many
people in Europe. The aficionados
are growing in numbers and
are ever more inventive, trying
to outdo each other in creativity
and dressing themselves up in
costumes that are far from the
Lycra capes and the red underpants
we used to wear as kids.
A genuine parade of freaks and
wonders, life-sized souvenirs
of the heroes who monopolized
our Saturday mornings, this 3rd
Cosplay Edition is from now on
what the anti-flea collar is to the
werewolf : indispensable !
BUT, this year, the cosplay contest
will be competitive for the
first time : the winner will have

take part in the European Cosplay
Competition !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
