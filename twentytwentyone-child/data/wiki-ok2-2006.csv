incurs the wrath of a neighbouring
woman over a property deal. The church
elders in their rural village declare that
Bell is guilty of loan-sharking and the
loss of his good name. To add insult
to injury, it’s been whispered that the
woman is in league with the devil, and
she swears vengeance upon Bell and
his family, especially his older daughter
Betsy. The girl begins seeing visions of
snarling wolves and a ghostly girl. Then,
one night Betsy is tormented by an unseen
attacker. School teacher Richard,
who is also Betsy’s suitor, initially reasons
away the supernatural aspect of
the attacks, but they become a nightly
occurrence that no one can do anything
to stop.
An American Haunting is based on true
events. It was the only time in history that
the American government has acknowledged
that supernatural forces were responsible
for someone’s death. Director
Courtney Solomon (Dungeons and Dragons)
has adapted Brent Monahan’s 1997
novel The Bell Witch : An American Haunting
for the big screen. He uses innovative
sound design and classical horror themes
to create a contemporary Gothic film that is
profoundly disturbing. Donald Sutherland

the cast as John and Lucy Bell. Newcomer
Rachel Hurd-Wood is cast as the tormented

Among the rolling fields of corn,
there’s a neat, white church. This house
of God is the terrain of Ivan, the priest to
whom the ex-con has been assigned for
a spot of rehabilitation and re-education.
Taciturn, sullen and aggressive, Adam
aims to get through this forced sojourn
as quickly as possible so he can join his
skinhead friends in the city and take up
his life of racism and drunken mayhem.
When the insanely optimistic Ivan asks
Adam what his goal is going to be during
his stay, Adam just answers he wants to
bake an apple pie. Ivan promptly assigns
him to protect the apple tree in front of
the church. Birds, worms and lightning
start to attack the apples. Ivan believes it
is the Devil that is testing him. But Adam
thinks it is God.
How do you persuade a neo-Nazi to bake
an apple pie? That is the challenge that
powers the wicked third feature of Danish
screenwriter ( Old Men in New Cars,
Brothers ) and director ( Golden Melies
2003 The Green Butchers ) Anders
Thomas Jensen. Partly absurd black
comedy, partly good-and-evil morality

Antarctic Journal is a powerful, claustrophobic

After winning our Golden Raven 2001

seems to be hungry for more. The nihilistic
frightener The Descent must be one
of the best horror movies in recent years.
In the first half of the film, he grabs us
by the throat with a bravura evocation of
the real-life terrors of entrapment. Then
the monsters arrive and The Descent
switches gear, turning into a shock feast

Danish director Christoffer Boe returns

Allegro is a stylish and
fascinating exercise about remembrance
and forgetting, related in atmosphere to
Tarkovsky’s Stalker and Godard’s Alphaville.
The film enjoys a spectacular

a distinct sense of irony and
a splendid soundtrack. Ulrich Thomsen

psychological trauma in abundance. This
should come as no surprise, as the film
is based on a novel by sci-fi guru Brian
Aldiss. It also benefits from a terrific
soundtrack, a sweltering hybrid of Small
Faces-styled classic rock and early, hyper-
angry UK punk, and the astonishing
performances from real-life twins Luke

of an old decrepit apartment building.
He doesn’t really want to live there,
but it’s his way of expressing his independence
from his mother. Every night,
he hears awful sounds of abuse emanating
from his neighbour’s apartment.
The noise turns out to be an abusive cop
who frequently beats his wife in front of
their young daughter. Marvin’s girlfriend,
Pinky tries to talk him into moving, but
he won’t let fear get the better of him.
When Marvin begins to see flashes of the
neighbour’s daughter drenched in blood,
he begins to worry about his sanity. But
there are far worse things than madness
at work in his apartment complex. Marvin
and Pinky must now confront the evil
in the apartment building or be forever
haunted by its secret.
The Echo is a terrific addition to the Asian
ghost movie genre, with a suffocating
atmosphere, impressive visuals and a
story that focuses firmly on the human
element. Philippine Director Yam Laranas
uses the dark and oppressive building as
a character in itself. The claustrophobic
hallways, the weird lighting and the slow
camera moves makes the paranoia and
the fear of Marvin almost tangible. These
spooky images are complemented by
equally creepy sound design. This subtle,
human ghost tale will haunt you long after
you’ve left the theatre"

mood of playful mystery, his hero’s journey
could either take place in a dream, a parallel

a strange occult ritual in his

falls in love with her. But Hoa hides a dark
secret which will drive Loc to the edge of
madness. 2) Only Child. Loc is still inhabiting
the old house. He’s being treated by
the beautiful psychiatry student Linh. She
doesn’t see a madman in him, but someone
of talent, driven by passion. Love blossoms
between them and they marry. But
Linh cannot bear him a child. She too has
a dark secret, which comes back to haunt
her with terrible consequences. 3) The Diviner.
Many years later. Loc, now a greyhaired
hermit, rents a room in his house
to the travelling spiritualist Lan. Through
her perspective, the story comes full circle
when she uncovers the troubled history
contained in the house.
Set in modern day Vietnam, Spirits is a
captivating introduction into Vietnamese
spiritual beliefs and mysteries through
three supernatural tales in which terror
thrives and ghostly shadows roam. Director
Victor Vu ( First Morning ) weaves
together traditional notions of karma and
reincarnation to explore the themes of obsession,
love and redemption. These three
stories, on the frontier between the world
of the living and the realm of the dead, are
at once heartbreaking and bloodcurdling
and are among the most chilling cinematic
parables in recent years."

of financial necessity, farmer Dan Reilly has
agreed to partake in what he thought were
simple fertility tests on his cattle; not knowing
that the private bio-tech laboratory he‘s
working for was secretly conducting illegal
experiments that run the risk of mutating
the livestock. The local vet, who is generously
compensated for her cooperation with
the lab, begins to suspect the tests are not
as harmless as everyone has been lead to
believe. Meanwhile, a teenage runaway and
her traveler boyfriend, who are evading the
police, stumble across the farm and are
inadvertently swept into this ghastly nightmare
that no-one could have predicted.
Isolation, the long feature debut of Billy
O’Brien, plays on the modern discomfort and
phobia related to rural life, adding the sinister
element of bio-technology. O’Brien has
a firm grip on the serious sides of the sci-fi
and horror genres, stirring up the anxiety
level with the help of a strong and talented
cast, but also by successfully exploiting the
dark and desolate environment. The viewer
is positioned right in between the characters
and what lurks into the shadows; an
entity that is swift, savage and destined to
disrupt the balance of nature. With John
Lynch (Sliding Doors, In The Name of the

Death Trance is a stylish over-the-top action
fantasy film starring Japan’s newest
star Tak Sakaguchi (Versus, Aragami,
Godzilla : Final Wars, Shinobi), based on
the best-selling manga by Kana Takeuchi.
Yuji Shimomura, best known for directing
the fight sequences for Versus,
makes his directorial debut. His film
embodies a mix of the modern Samurai
movie with highly stylized post-apocalyptic
Mad Max cinematography. Filmed
amongst the ancient ruins of rural Japan,
Death Trance depicts non-stop battles
between sword and gun, mortal and immortal,
myth and reality."

Nini, she meets her neighbour in the lift,
who looks frightened when she finds out
where Lin is staying. At Nini’s school,
Lin bumps into another neighbour, Feng,
who says he lives next door. Feng seems
very friendly and caring. He can even
do magic tricks by picking a real flower
from a picture on the wall. Then, strange
things start to happen. Lin hears someone
sighing. She also finds Nini talking
to herself, as if there’s somebody there.
One evening, hearing the sighs again,
Lin sees an apparition of a long-haired

she will suffer the same terrible fate as
her and her daughter.
Known as a director (Untold Story, Ebola
Syndrome, Troublesome Night) as well as
a cinematographer, in particular for the
films of Tsui Hark (Time & Tide, Zu Warriors,
Seven Swords), Herman Yau takes
on the horror genre with Ghost Within.
Even if the usual ingredients of Asian
horror are present (ghosts, girls with
long black hair, water,…), Yau concentrates
on the growing fear and hysteria
of his heroine, interpreted with gusto by
Barbie Hzu (Silk), the young rising star of
Chinese cinema."

Lie Still, the debut feature of Sean Hogan

Does this have something to do with
what happened two years ago. On a business

British director John Williams (Firefly

at each end of the room. Finally he gives up
the struggle and collapses in exhaustion.
Then he begins to remember images from
his past. Clinging to these images, he creeps
forward with the last ounces of his strength
and meets a woman in a place that stinks
of rotting corpses. They both try to recall
where they came from, but their memories
are so uncertain that they are not even sure
they want to return. The man is ready to give
up, but the woman insists on going forward.
Neither of them can imagine the incredible
end to the journey.
Last year, Shinya Tsukamoto (Tetsuo I & II,
Tokyo Fist, Snake of June) won our Silver
Raven with Vital and played the lead in our
Golden Raven Marebito. This year, he returns
with Haze, an innovatively perverse, digitally
shot middle-length feature that forces us to
share the extreme claustrophobia and the
mental and physical torture of the protagonist.
As with most of his previous films,
Tsukamoto writes, directs, edits and stars.
Kaori Fuji, the heroine from Tokyo Fist, is the
female lead. Chu Ishikawa’s score adds an
aggressive beat to the film."

them less then happy campers, but if

25-year-old Ti West’s acclaimed feature

horror host segments fronted by Tom

barn that Hitchcock used for Marnie,
takes its horror elements dead serious,
creating a ghoulish universe where a

sent by her psychiatrist on a trip to
recuperate. She visits an old family flat
in a remote apartment by the sea. Heavily
sedated with medication and alcohol,
she tries to decode her life through

she becomes obsessed with it, takes it

Swedish friend Milla visits at the weekend.
While out drinking with Dawn, she
catches a man at an unguarded moment

creature can sense the vibrations from
the bedroom. They make it stronger, they
make it grow. After Milla leaves, Dawn
checks on the creature in the cellar. He‘s
covered in a fine slime. Drawn to the

effects. Dawn’s life is about to
get even stranger.
Venus Drowning is the third feature by
British director Andrew Parkinson, of
whom we screened Dead Creatures at the

of formats (Super16, DigiBeta, Dvcam,

a B-movie creature feature, a psychedelic

American culture. It marked a revolt and
a revision of the dominant cultural values
of the post-war world, driven clearly by the
emergence of a worldwide youth culture.
This shift in aesthetics and content is best
represented by a handful of feature films
made during the 70ties that became known
as “midnight movies” : El Topo (1970) by Alejandro
Jodorowsky, Night of the Living Dead
(1968) by George A. Romero, The Harder They
Come (1972) by Perry Henzell, Pink Flamingos
(1972) by John Waters, The Rocky Horror
Picture Show (1975) by Jim Sharman and
Eraserhead (1977) by David Lynch.
These movies re-invented the film medium
while pushing the boundaries of bad taste
and social taboos. Attending midnight movies
became a social identifier, mark of a
person’s cinematic sensibilities and a rite of
passage for a whole youth generation in crisis.
As a result, much of today’s movie audiences
have come to accept the abnormal as
normal, the bizarre as better, the grotesque
as good, sexual diversity as fashionable and
the definition of sanity as relative. Directed
and produced by Stuart Samuels, the documentary
Midnight Movies : From the Margin
to the Mainstream includes in-depth interviews
with the directors, producers, writers
and actors who were part of these low-budget,
yet monumental productions, the exhibitors
and distributors who played them
and the audiences who viewed them."

a snail. Another snail arrives and
despairs over the death of her fellow
gastropod. Then the King arrives in his
fantasy underworld. Maybe he’s the conscience
or the inner psyche of the snailkiller
? The King has a minstrel. He plays

To that end he injects himself with
snail juice. Then a praying mantis kills
a snail and a mentally handicapped person.
This is just the beginning.
It’s almost impossible to describe What
Is It?, the labour of love of actor Crispin
Glover (Back to the Future, Charlie’s Angels,
Willard). He spent nine years making
this amazing piece of experimental
cinema, acting as the writer, director,
producer, star and sole financier. If you’d
ask him what it’s about, he would say
: “It’s about the adventures of a young
man whose principal interests are snails,
salt, a pipe and how to get home. He’s
tormented by a hubristic, racist inner
psyche.” Most of the cast have Down
syndrome and the acts in which they
engage will have you squirming in your

in this whirlpool of wild and weird images,

Behind this baroque imagery lies the film’s real

of the extremes people go to in order to preserve
belief systems and in its exposure of abuse of
power. For over 30 years the film was only available

Omen and The Exorcist are programmed
together with lesser known but equally
“possessed” films such as The Devil
Rides Out, The Witchfinder General, La
main du diable, Mother Joan of the Angels
and Night of the Demon.
One of the main events is the screening
of Ken Russell’s original version of The
Devils. This film will be accompanied by
Hell on Earth, an hour-long documentary
by Paul Joyce about the digital restoration
of The Devils, which explores the dispute
over this highly controversial film and also
features the notorious “Rape of Christ”
footage that was believed to have been
destroyed due to its extreme content.
The director’s cut is screened the day
before at Cinema Nova. Both screenings
will be introduced by documentary filmmaker
Paul Joyce and the films original
editor Mike Bradsell who supervised the
restoration.
In addition, the festival’s guest of honour,

Thou shall enjoy belonging to a public with
a ritual of its own, enjoy sharing a film
passion. Enjoy the marvellous procession
of theatre groups, the exhibitions changing
the face of the Auditorium and Nova, the
unique spectacles and manifestations
such as the Unusual Fashion Show, Make-
Up and Body Painting Contest and the divinely
pagan closing party, the immortal
Bal of the Vampires.
For them, the second command will be:
Thou shall endure.
Thou shall endure 16 days, day and night,
three to five films a day, a day of
Japanimation, a Belgian Fantastic Film Day,
numerous midnight screenings, and on top
of that two film nights from dusk till dawn.
For them, the third and most important
command will be: Thou shall keep an open
mind. And if you do that, you will be taken
on board a major international event, probably
one of the most important in its genre.
You will discover wondrous worlds of fantastic
film and admire the ever-changing
film landscape, with as this year’s focal
points: the restoration of the Frankenstein
myth, the continuing rising of the dead, the
fast spread of the fantastic virus all over
Asia, the disturbing emergence of ghosts
and ghouls, the proliferation of spiritual
and pagan themes, the entry of new and
promising talent, the re-entry of the masters
of horror, the horror…

of local fantastic film production
with the organisation of the 11th
workshop “Fantastic Brussels”. The goal is
to offer the students of our film schools RITS
& NARAFI the opportunity to gain experience
through the making of a fantastic short
under the supervision of an experienced
foreign film director. Nick Willing, the young
British director of successful genre movies
such as “Photographing Fairies” (winner of
the Golden Méliès 1998), “Doctor Sleep”
and “The River King” has accepted this task.
As a location for the shooting we have chosen
Tour & Taxis, a spectacular Brussels
site which will, without a doubt, inspire the
students in the making of imaginative and
visionary fantastic films. The three shorts
will have their premiere during the Day of
Belgian Fantastic Film on Friday the 17th
of March around 5:30 pm at the Botanique.
Following this public screening, we
will reward some of the students for their
outstanding work on these projects. The
author’s society SACD will offer a prize to
the most personal scriptwriting or directing
and Eye-Lite will provide one student with
a value of 2,500 € in lightning material for
his/her next film project.
The workshop is made possible thanks
to the help of our logistical sponsors : the
Jean-Pierre Finotto Make-Up School, Eye-
Lite for sound and lightning material, Cine
& FX for SFX and postproduction facilities,
APPLE and Double Precision for digital editing
cells and Key Grip Systems for the grip
material. Thanks to the collaboration and
the support of the Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie,
Dienst Onderwijs & Dienst Cultuur,

2006,event,Art Exhibition,,,"Marc,",,,,"This internationally
renowned artist can present a n
impressive résumé. But that’s not the
point. The evolution of an artist can be
traced by his work. Behind every journey,
there’s a story and in this case it starts
with : “Once upon a time a little boy became
intrigued by the magic world of insects
and frogs”. Later encounters and
voyages helped to forge his art. Marc
has managed to preserve his childhood
emotions and his creativity. He presents
his fantastic works, using imaginative
methods. Instinctively, he has appropriated
and transformed a part of Lewis
Caroll’s magical world. At an intersection,
Alice asks the cat : “Which way do I
have to go?”. The cat replies “Where do
you want to go?”. Alice answers : “I don’t
know”, whereupon the cat concludes :
“Go wherever you want to.” The metaphor
stimulates the imagination of the
right half of the brain, which represents
childhood, creativity and the dream. This
in opposition to the logically-deductive
and mathematical left side of the brain.
Geniuses use both.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
