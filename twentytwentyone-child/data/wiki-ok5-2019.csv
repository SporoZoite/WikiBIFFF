quickly grows fond of the solitary widow. But then she discovers a dark side to Greta’s maternal

Aaarrrgh! Isabelle Huppert playing another piano teacher after her psycho turn

She tries to turn the page by taking her young son to a new

away from it all, isn’t it? But one night, she wakes up with a sense of foreboding, prompting her
to reconnoiter with her flashlight at the ready. Almost on her back doorstep, she finds a gigantic
sinkhole, the terrestrial equivalent of those black holes in outer space: anything that gets sucked
in is irretrievably lost. When on top of that her son starts behaving weirdly and she has a terrifying
encounter with a bizarre neighbor, her already distraught mind risks becoming seriously unhinged.
Will she hold her ground or will she sink into the quagmire of panic and paranoia?
In 2013 Irish screenwriter-director Lee Cronin won the Silver Raven for Best
European Fantastic Short with GHOST TRAIN. THE HOLE IN THE GROUND,
his first feature, was promptly selected for the prestigious Sundance Festival. For
this nerve-shattering mix of horror and psychodrama, he went fishing in the same
pond as THE OMEN, THE SHINING, and HEREDITARY. We can think of worse

her free time is mostly spent in front of her television set. One day, she gets a telephone call from
a certain Martin Martin, who was coaxed into doing so by his daughter Sarah. Could Rose maybe
help with a teeny-weeny little matter, namely Martin’s dearly departed wife? Notwithstanding the
sparks that fly between them, Rose initially refuses. But then Sarah falls prey to a washed-up rock
star looking to use her in a satanic pact meant to revive his career. Will they succeed in saving her
before she is ritually sacrificed during the next lunar eclipse?
Before venturing info feature filmmaking, the Irish directorial duo Enda
Loughman and Mike Ahern honed their skills with a few shorts. EXTRA
ORDINARY, their full-length debut, is a lighthearted supernatural comedy. Lovers
of offbeat Irish humor, slapstick shenanigans, and a bit of romance will know what

Mr. Snowcone leads her into temptation and lures her outside, where it doesn’t look half as
dangerous as her father warned her against. But maybe he was right all along?
Directors Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein were inspired by the policies of sitting
American president Donald Trump. Apart from an incredibly pertinent theme,
we see some BIFFF regulars on screen: Emile Hirsch, Chloe’s father, featured in
THE AUTOPSY OF JANE DOE last year and in KILLER JOE in 2012. Bruce Dern,
who plays Mr. Snowcone, was seen in CUT BANK in 2015. FREAKS begins in

In his first feature, Australian filmmaker Tony D’Aquino zooms in on the survival
games you can follow on line or on the small screen. He clearly found inspiration
in films like BATTLE ROYALE, DIVERGENT, THE MAZE RUNNER, and other
HUNGER GAMES. The result is a no-holds-barred horror thriller for which the

This suspenseful religious thriller from Argentina fishes in the same troubled

But brace yourself for a postmodern twist that wouldn’t shame Charlie Kaufman!
Among the actors, we notice familiar faces like Sofía Del Tuffo (LUCIFERINA,

a zombie invasion, which unfolds after an experiment at a nearby military base goes awry. Armed

Abe Forsythe is an Australian actor turned director. LITTLE MONSTERS is

own words–that must be a whole new genre by the way) he succeeded in getting a
fine bunch of actors: Lupita Nyong’o (US, BLACK PANTHER, STAR WARS: THE

One of the surprises this year comes out of Thailand. Twelve years ago, the director
Ping Lumpraleng came upon such pool while scouting for locations. He wondered

Don’t trust your neighbors! That’s the underlying message in RED LETTER DAY

Kasten calls THE DEAD ONES, with four unknown Baltimore youngsters as lead

KILLER WEEKEND reads the title and that’s pretty much how the film can be

classic British humor we know from SHAUN OF THE DEAD, director and writer
Ben Kent based his scenario on a bad experience of a friend who took part in

fleeing the war that’s raging in large parts of the continent. When young Yaku’s father dies and
she learns she’s expecting, she decides to go and look for a more suitable place to raise her
unborn child. Along with her husband, she starts the long trek towards the sea. During their
hazardous journey through desolate landscapes, they also meet a cynical war correspondent, who
keeps his cards close to his chest. Will he use them for a quick scoop or will he have a heart and
help them on their way towards a better life?
If you’ve kept up with global developments, you’ll know that the next world war
will be fought over water rather than oil. That is also the premise of the stark
apocalyptic thriller THE UNSEEN, a kind of waterless WATERWORLD with
royal doses of MAD MAX. Starring are some well-known faces from Argentinian
cinema: Peter Lanzani (THE CLAN), Natalia Oreiro (THE GERMAN DOCTOR,
CLANDESTINE CHILDHOOD), and Alejandro Awada (THE BAR, THE AURA,
NINE QUEENS).",,

Passing from Lars von Trier to Michael Bay without blushing, Udo Kier is greedily searching for more experience and doesn’t care what anyone says. In 1970, he started with MARK OF THE DEVIL, which would be censored in 31 countries. He met Paul Morrissey, with whom he would shoot two cult films (FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD FOR DRACULA) and right after that, he would star in Dario Argento’s SUSPIRIA. When a clear career path in genre cinema opened for him, he would take a tangent real quick: we saw him in Gus van Sant’s MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO, he played twice alongside his friend Keanu Reeves (including in JOHNNY MNEMONIC), he hammed it up with Jim Carrey and Pamela Anderson (in respectively ACE VENTURA and BARB WIRE), and he joined his dear friend Madonna in her music videos. However, his packed filmography is even longer for between two film shoots with his pal Von Trier, he worked with for example Rob Zombie (HALLOWEEN, THE LORDS OF SALEM) and Robert Rodriguez (GRINDHOUSE).

enjoy a renewed interest from audiences and critics
in times of social and economic turmoil. Needless to say,
the harvest is particularly rich in the current international
climate!
Italy comes up with not only extremists who seek refuge
in an asylum centre (GO HOME), but also fascism incarnate
(Il Duce Mussolini himself) making a comeback in the
twenty-first century (I’M BACK)! The Scandinavians focus
on cross-border terrorism (THE UNTHINKABLE) and climate
disasters (THE QUAKE). The Koreans threaten to unleash
the Third World War (TAKE POINT) while the Americans
try to come to terms with their multiple mass murders
(THE DEAD ONES).
Dystopias are also doing well, thank you very much. LEVEL
16 confronts us with the cosmetic exploitation of orphans,
ROCK STEADY ROW makes a devastating judgment about
the American education system, and ANIARA plans a forced
exodus to the planet Mars...
For those who persist in believing in mankind, do not panic!
The 37th edition of the BIFFF has a lot of big guns at the
ready: PET SEMATARY, HELLBOY, IRON SKY 2 (THE COMING
RACE), GRETA, ASSASSINATION NATION, THE BEACH BUM,
DRAGGED ACROSS CONCRETE, and LITTLE MONSTERS.
In total we will screen 97 films: ten world premieres,
eleven international, and ten European premieres, with a
selection that will take you to the far corners of India and
Thailand! There is also news from the home front, with
nine Belgian feature films or co-productions, including THE
ROOM (with Olga Kurylenko and Kevin Janssens), PLAY OR
DIE, EXTRA ORDINARY, and THE HOLE IN THE GROUND.
Among the numerous novelties is the very first ZOMBIFFF
RUN, during which the participants run the risk of being
eaten alive in an apocalyptic setting in the heart of
Brussels! Another delicacy for demanding film lovers is
the NANARLAND screening, a delicious double bill with
SAMURAI COP and TROLL 2. Nostalgic souls will be delighted
by the return of rafting-on-a-sea-of-humans, in
collaboration with the Magic Land Theater.

self-assembly furniture (with somehow always one piece left unused), and
a social model that is the envy of all of Europe, the Nordic countries also
have a prestigious cinematographic pedigree. Impossible not to mention Ingmar Bergman – whose THE VIRGIN SPRING inspired Wes
Craven’s THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT – and Aki Kaurismäki
among the cinematic heavyweights. The long winters in northern Europe are of course ideal to cuddle under a blanket, resulting (9 months

that will give you indigestion. We start off with
the cult gem SAMOURAI COP (1991), in which the
sword fighting title hero “speak fluent” Japanese,
or something. Though this film may have the
reputation of being one of the worst ever, what
follows is not bad either. On Rotten Tomatoes,
the ridiculously bad TROLL 2 (those vegetarian

six percent score. Director Claudio Fragasso wrote
the dialogues phonetically in English, a language
