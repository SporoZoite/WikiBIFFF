Since the 60ties, the community has been struck
by an unusually high number of disappearances. Psychologist
Abigail Tyler becomes intrigued by the similar testimonies
of inhabitants with sleeping problems. They all
claim to dream about a white owl on their window ledge.
When Abigail hypnotises one of her patients to find out
more, he completely freaks out. After the session, he goes
home to kill his wife. The local sheriff warns her to let
sleeping dogs lie. But Abigail persists in her enquiries,
especially when she discovers a recording of herself
shouting in an unknown language. An expert deciphers
her words as ancient Sumerian. When another of Abigail’s
patients dies, the sheriff puts her under house arrest. This
will not stop the mysterious forces at work in Nome.
Starting from the fifties, people all over the world began to
claim that they had seen extraterrestrial beings. In 1972,
a scale was established to categorize these contacts.
Observation of a UFO was an encounter of the first kind.
Gathering evidence qualified as an encounter of the second
kind. A meeting with alien visitors was an encounter
of the third kind. When someone was abducted by
aliens, it was considered an encounter of the fourth kind.
The Fourth Kind, the debut feature of
Olatunde Osunsamni, is a scary
and exciting blend of fiction,
archive material and “real”
testimonies, starring Milla
Jovovich ( The 5th Element,
Resident Evil ) as Abigail
Tyler and with Will Patton
( Armageddon, The Punisher )

himself Kick-Ass and starts hitting the streets… literally.
But Dave is not the only self-styled vigilante in town. Big
Daddy and Hit Girl, a father and daughter team, are already
getting tough on crime. Compared to this paramilitary
version of Batman and Robin, Dave is an amateur,
even though Big Daddy’s caped crusader adheres more to
old-school Adam West antics than to the tough and dark
Christian Bale style. Hit Girl is a spunky little assassin with
a foul mouth who dispenses justice without mercy. There
are no heroes without villains of course. And the nemesis
of our three avengers is Frank D’Amico, a ruthless gangster
kingpin who wants to monopolize crime in the city.
Kick-Ass is an ultra-violent superhero homage from Stardust
director Matthew Vaugn that really lives up to its
name. The movie has an energy that just keeps building
and building, exploding on the screen in an avalanche of
action and mayhem. Vaughn layers the film with numerous
references to superhero movies, action flics and
even spaghetti westerns and provides it with a soundtrack
of driving rock, pumping beats and some classic
tunes. Chloe Moretz ( The Amityville
Horror ) is sensational as the
miniature killing machine Hit
Girl. Nicolas Cage ( The rock,
Adaptation ) provides comic
relief as Big Daddy. Sherlock
Holmes villain Mark
Strong sticks to the bad side

finally get an answer to the question that is haunting
so many genre lovers : if vampires would take over the

writer, would be an understatement. Every
time a new book comes out, sales go through the
roof, while the critics drip their pencils in acid. You
see, Roth writes about serial killers and the like and
that is not something that is very much appreciated in
those highbrow literary circles. So Roth tells his editor
that he wants to switch genres, since he has the
strange feeling of being slowly eaten alive by his paper
nightmares. Sensing the troubled mind of his goose
with the golden eggs, his editor suggests a delightful
little holiday to Italy with the wife to get some fresh
air and inspiration. But even here, Christopher Roth
cannot shake off his reputation as one of the greatest
horror writers, especially when a local groupie starts
to execute the macabre stories of his books.
Maxime Alexandre aka Max Sender, encouraged by
his experience as a DOP in the States ( The Hills have
Eyes 1, Mirrors and The crazies – also presented at
BIFFF 2010 ), delights us with a tense and schizophrenic
script that brings some fresh air to the genre.
Christopher Roth is served by a three stars cast (Ben
Gazzara, Joaquim de Almeida, Anna Galiena), and a
smart mix of drama, thriller and horror that does not
take the audience for idiots."

you some rest from the existential anxieties of life.
At first, Paul is satisfied with his inner being stored

French-born, American trained Sophie Barthes’ first

Pal Oie, director of Dark Woods ( BIFFF 2004 ), uses
the sumptuous Norwegian woods, waterfalls and
mountains to maximum effect, creating a dreamlike
landscape full of unnameable tension. Stylistically
and visually, his second film is a big step ahead.
We’re immediately swept into the story thanks to the
hypnotic performance of Kristoffer Joner ( Next Door,
The Man Who Loved Yngve ) as Kai, a man having to

The arrival of Ondine turns his world upside down. Annie

With Ondine, the director of The Company of Wolves, The
Crying Game and Interview With The Vampire returns to
his Irish roots. Neil Jordan’s Ondine is a lyrical fairytale
that effortlessly blends myth and fantasy with the hard
life of an Irish fishing community. This contemporary fable

The performances of Colin Farrell

Soo-jin disappears. He-jin is sick with worry.
Soo-jin never fully recovered mentally from the car
crash that killed their father. But their fanatically religious
mother doesn’t even call the police. All she does
is pray to God. When He-jin seeks help from a police
inspector, the man flatly tells her that this is just a
typical case of a teenage runaway. Soo-jin will come
home by herself. But when people in their apartment
building start committing suicide and leave behind
sorry notes addressed to Soo-jin, the case takes on
a dark and macabre turn. The inspector and He-jin
discover that Soo-jin had special gifts, like prayer
healing and fortune telling. Their mother thinks she’s
a messenger from God, but others believe she’s possessed
by an evil spirit.
If you think that Possessed is going to be just another
Asian ghost movie with a vengeful, longhaired
female ghost, you couldn’t be further from the truth.
The first feature film of Yong-joo Lee is a lot more
intelligent, ambitious and scary than the numerous
The Ring and The Grudge clones that washed over
us in recent years. Lee focuses on how the different
characters react to supernatural
phenomena and gives the audience
time to think about what
happens in stead of going
for the traditional shock
& scare bombardment.
Possessed is a strong
and promising debut from
a director who will continue
to surprise us in the years
to come."

where he also became a household name as a member
of a comedy duo. Contrary to Kitano, Matsumoto
skipped the phase of directing yakuza films and immediately
profiled himself as a highly original and eccentric
movie maker. Symbol is another brilliant achievement.
This surreal comedy effortlessly connects the manga
universe with absurd humour and popular culture. You

succeeds in bringing
together his two completely

Life and Death of a Porno Gang is something completely

Djordjevic earned himself a reputation with his two horror

The Danish iconoclast Nicolas Winding Refn, author
of the gangster trilogy Pusher, Fear X ( Bifff 2004 ) and

way that would make a berserker faint. Refn mercilessly
destroys any religious justification for whatever carnage

strange and desolate that it almost looks like another

Mikkelsen ( Pusher, Casino Royale, The Door ) gives, as

Outcast is an Irish-Scottish horror film from Colm McCarthy,

The Tudors, Murphy’s Law and Hustle. What’s unique
about Outcast is the grim social context in which all the

ancient Irish and Scottish myths are
integrated in a contemporary setting,
lends lots of authenticity

An epidemic of madness is affecting the citizens of
Ogden Marsh with dazzling speed. Those who have
not fallen prey to the infective rage, try to barricade
themselves. David, his pregnant wife Judy, medical
assistant Becca and David’s assistant Russell must
try to survive the night and escape from the raging
creatures that used to be their family, friends and
colleagues.
This year, you’re not only going to savour the new
Romero, you’ll also be able to enjoy this most excellent
remake of his horror classic from 1973. Behind
the camera, Breck Eisner, director of Thoughtcrimes
and Sahara and for the moment busy preparing the
remake of Flash Gordon. In front of the camera, nothing
but acting goodness : Timothy Olyphant ( Seth
Bullock from Deadwood ) tries to lay down the law as
David Dutton and Radha Mitchell
( Silent Hill, Pitch Black, Finding
Neverland ) stands by
her man as Judy. Another
asset of this horror fest is
the script by remake specialists
Ray Wright ( Pulse,
Case 39 ) and Scott Kosar
( The Amityville Horror, The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre )."

Michael Farr, who drives the guests around during
the festival, uses the occasion to get his head
straight. Indeed, life hasn’t been kind to him lately:
his beloved wife has passed away, his two kids are
as joyful as a tombstone and daddy-in-law has also
kicked the bucket. He becomes attracted to Lena Morelle,
a female Stephen King, who desperately tries
to flee from the lustful assaults of Nicholas Holden,
a world-renowned hard drinking American novelist.
But if Holden circles her like a hawk with the obvious
purpose to get laid, Michael has other reasons
to be interested in her. For some time now, he’s been
plagued by terrifying apparitions…
The Eclipse, a haunting love story that is inspired in
some ways by Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s work, has already
gathered lots of awards on the international festival

performance as Paul. Aidan Quinn ( Benny &

enjoys himself playing the
dreadful character of Nicholas
Holden. And the delicious
Iben Hjelje ( High

Heartless, the first feature of cult director Philip Ridley
( The Reflecting Skin, The Passion of Darkly Noon )
in 14 years, is a mind blowing study in pain and terror,
physical as well as mental, and a violently explicit
horror movie. Ridley uses the cliché’s of the genre

vision of a society about to collapse. Like no

beautiful images. Jim Sturges ( Across The Universe )

woman who falls for a younger
man, a great performance from
Emma Caulfield ( Anya from
Buffy ) and John Patrick
Amedori ( The Butterfly Effect
), is finally something
else than the glamorous
old Hollywood goat who can
have his pick among the fresh
green leaves."
2010,movie ,,,UNDER THE MOUNTAIN,Jonathan King,2009,New Zealand,European,,"Emma Caulfield, Michelle Borth, John Patrick Amedori, Desmond Harrington",,,,,,,91',"Drama, Adventure, Fantasy",,,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1275861/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1,,,,,"Theo and Rachel are no ordinary twins.
They’re capable of communicating with each
other without words and can sometimes feel what the
other one goes through. Their special connection is
brutally cut when their mother dies in an accident.
Theo closes himself off from the world and shuts
Rachel out. Their father is an emotional wreck. He
sends the twins to live with their uncle and aunt in
Auckland. It seems to be the ideal place for Theo and
Rachel to recuperate, if it wasn’t for the run down
house at the edge of the lake. Its inhabitants, the
Wilberforces take an unhealthy and macabre interest
in the twins. Mr. Jones, their neighbour, takes them
under his protection. He’s got a score to settle with
The Wilberforces and only Theo and Rachel can help
him beat them. But to do this, they will have to repair
their special bond.
And now something completely different from Black
Sheep director Jonathan King. He surprises us with
this beautiful adaptation of a popular New Zealand
children’s novel. The gorgeously visualised story
could count on sfx provided by Peter Jackson’s Weta
Workshop ( King Kong, Lord of the Rings ). Luckily King
manages to avoid the sweet and syrupy approach of
the current craze in adolescent fantasy. His characters
are fragile creatures of flesh and blood and you
just know that if the Wilberforces ever get their hands
on Theo and Rachel, gruesome things will happen to
them. Sam Neil ( Jurrasic Park, The Piano, Daybreakers
) is outstanding, as always, as Mr. Jones, but it’s
New Zealand’s volcano’s that steal the show in Under
The Mountain."

a small fishing town in the Northwest, is going
through some tough economic times. There’s no
longer any fish to be caught and the locals are looking
for someone to blame. Their first victim is Frida,
a college student with Arab roots who’s come back
for the summer to help out in her father’s restaurant.
But who wants to be served by a “terrorist” ? Victim
number two is Tom. Years ago he left Port Gamble
to come out of the closet in the big city. Now he’s
finally found the courage to tell his parents, with his
lover Lance in tow as moral support. When hordes
of flesh eating zombies invade Port Gamble, the narrow-
minded locals and the liberal city slickers have
to bond together in order to survive.
You’ve got two kinds of zombie flics. In the first, the
undead are just an excuse for a gore fest. In the second,
our beloved brain eaters serve as a metaphor to
denounce the many wrongs of our world. Not that we
don’t like a decent hack and slash orgy, but we’ve always
had a preference for the George A. Romero school
of zombie horror. Zombies of Mass Destruction, the
first feature of young Kevin Hamedani, enthusiastically
denounces homophobia, islamophobia, terror phobia
and other kinds of 21st century popular entertainment,
without being stingy on the necessary messing around
with intestines, limbs and bodily fluids."

No !

Eleven manically obsessed film freaks who wear down one dvd drive after another, one movie theatre seat after another at home and abroad, who knock, pounce, beat and scream at doors that remain more shut than open, who fish for pearls in an ocean of sharks but never despair, never quit, never give up and never surrender, who are often completely insufferable to their fellow humans, but who are always all for one and one for all, who share each other’s misery, who share each other’s dreams, who try to see into the future with bloodshot eyes, who are all hopelessly addicted to the big screen, who are all united for one goal :

To come up with a program that will blow you of your socks !

This year we have, as usual, a very versatile and colourful program, with a strong representation from Scandinavia, the Celtic Fringe and England and a tendency for an extremely violent and explicit thematic treatment.
 
80 films on the menu, spread between our different sections : the International Competition, the European Méliès Competition, the 7th Orbit, the Thriller Competition ( for the second time ), the Fantastic Section, the Japanimation, the Extreme & Funny Midnight Screenings and the Belgian Movie Day with its Belgian Fantastic Short Film Competition.

2010,event,"Belgian Fantastic Film Day, 6th Belgian Fantastic Film Day",,6th Belgian Fantastic Film Day,,,,,"On April 16th 2010, our country is in the spotlights !
The Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival is
an efficient work tool for movie professionals, from
Belgium and from abroad : directors, producers,
distributors and journalists.
At a local level, the platform offered by the Festival
is made up of some 60.000 spectators ( since its
creation, the Festival has aimed at giving the widest
possible access to the largest possible audience ),
half of them diehard movie buffs ( who are also
opinion leaders according to a CRIOC survey ).
Since 1988, the BIFFF has opened its program
to short features by creating an international
competition. In 2004, the Festival reorganized this
section in order to give it greater visibility. Therefore,
the short movie competition and the presentation
of the results of our student’s workshop Fantastic
Brussels are shown on the same day, allowing film
students and professionals to mix.
Finally, in 2005, the Festival inaugurated a
competition dedicated to Belgian fantastic short
features.
Since 1996, the BIFFF is also one of the few festivals
that actively produces audiovisual content. Every
year, students from Brussels’ film schools ( this year,
the RITS and the INSAS ) will write, produce, shoot
and edit two to three short features, this under the
supervision of an experienced foreign genre director.
Presence and visibility of Belgian
productions
The BIFFF is aware of the added value it can offer to
the international promotion of a film: it seizes every
opportunity to select Belgian long feature films.
The sole restrictions: we ask for the Belgian premiere
and the subject must, of course, be true to the BIFFF
spirit, which isn’t that obvious for a small country
such as Belgium that is not especially known for
its genre cinema ( except for a short period in the
seventies ).
The BIFFF is a real focus of interest for the entire
community of festivals on a European and worldwide
scale: the movies of Harry Cleven, Olivier Smolders,
Gilles Daoust, …, started their successful tour on the
international festival circuit at the BIFFF. Therefore, we
can state without a doubt that the BIFFF is a decisive
factor in the promotion of Belgian long and short
features.
Presence and visibility of Belgian artists
The presence of Belgian artists and professionals in
the various long feature juries.
The many Plastic Art exhibitions at T&T with works of
Belgian artists.
There is also a significant evolution that needs to be
pointed out: if the Festival has become a “Cultural
Ambassador of the Brussels Capital Region”, it has
also become an ambassador for all the artists who
have displayed their works at the BIFFF. If high profile
artists such as H.R. GIGER or Yoshikata AMADO
decide to exhibit their works at the Festival ( while
taking in charge all transport costs ! ), it’s obviously
because the Festival offers them an international
visibility that can not be found elsewhere. Now most
of the exhibitors are either Walloons, Flemish or
from Brussels and, as it is the case for the Belgian  filmmakers, these artists quickly exhibit at other
festivals in Belgium, Europe and across the world.
The impact is probably even more important when
it comes to theater companies. The history and the
success of the Magic Land Theatre is intimately
linked to the Festival. This goes as well for the Make-
Up Contest, which has opened many professional
doors for its participants.

2010,event,"Workshop, 15th Workshop ""Brussels Fantastic""",,"15th Workshop ""Brussels Fantastic""","Antti-Jussi, Annila",,,,"There are tons of legends about the first steps of great
filmmakers : Steven Spielberg, for instance, used to
shoot his tin soldiers on the beach with his super-8
camera. Jean-Pierre Jeunet worked at a post office
and telecommunications service before he met Marc
Caro. And Quentin Tarantino sat behind his video store
desk, watching an endless stream of B to Z movies
all day long. Of course, it’s twice as more rewarding
to succeed when you are self-taught, but that doesn’t
necessarily means that it’s the only way to get what
you want. Imagine for one second the ordeal of
all those movie dreamers if they were just given a
camera and were told : “Ok, now you’re on your own,
deal with it !”? They wouldn’t know what to do.
That is why the BIFFF values its Workshop so much.
This experience, unique in the world, was created by
the festival in 1995. Since 2009, the
Workshop allows students from two
movie schools ( RITS and INSAS ) to
be part of the entire creative process
of making two short movies in
Brussels ; this under the professional
care of a foreign guest director invited by the BIFFF.
Our guest for this 15th edition is a native from Santa
Claus’ homeland : Antti-Jussi Annila, the Finnish
director of Jade Warrior ( 2006 ) and the multiawarded
Sauna ( 2008 ), both shown at the BIFFF.
At the end of the projection, the winner will be given
the Eye-Lite Award ( 2500 € of lightning equipment
for a next project ). The BIFFF will also award some
students with two prizes for those who distinguished
themselves during the shooting.
Let us seize the opportunity to warmly thank the
Flemish Community Commission of the Brussels
Capital Region and our professional partners
