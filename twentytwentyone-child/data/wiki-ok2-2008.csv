operation to replace her corneas. Afterward, she almost immediately begins seeing strange
things, which her sister Helen, conductor Simon McCullough and specialist Dr. Faulkner assume
at first is simply a result of disorientation in adjusting to her new, sensory-overload world.
But the visions become more vivid and disturbing. Sydney gets premonitions of deaths, then
sees the victims being led away by ghouls. She experiences hallucinatory nightmares
involving people trapped in a fire. When the late, anonymous eye donor begins
to appear in her mirror, Sydney convinces the reluctant Dr. Faulkner to go with
her to Mexico to find out what the dead donor is trying to communicate from
the beyond.
The Eye is the Hollywood remake of the 2002 Thai horror sensation by Danny
and Oxide Pang. French co-directors David Moreau and Xavier Palud earned
their credentials in 2006 with their shocking horror debut Them. They’ve
done an excellent job in creating a uniquely haunting atmosphere in which
the real and spiritual worlds are unpleasantly hard to separate. Jessica
Alba ( Sin City, Into The Blue, Fantastic Four ) is undoubtedly the star of
the movie as vision-struck violinist Sydney Wells. With solid supporting
performances from Alessandro Nivola ( Face/Off, Jurassic Park III ) as
Dr. Faulkner, Parker Posey ( Blade : Trinity, Superman Returns ) as Helen
Wells and Rade Serbedzija ( Mission Impossible II, Batman Begins ) as
Sydney’s conductor."

to mount a horse on a railroad bridge. Convalescing in a beautiful, austere old hospital, he learns
that he may lose the use of his legs. A respite from this deep depression comes in the form of a little
girl named Alexandra, an immigrant from Eastern Europe who has broken her arm picking apples.
In her, Roy sees an escape. They make a deal. He will tell her the most fantastic story imaginable
and she will steal morphine from the hospital pharmacy for him, just in case he cannot take it
anymore. So begins a most extraordinary tale featuring five heroes, each from a different corner
of the globe, all out to avenge the wrongs wrought by a powerful aristocrat.
The Fall, a visually innovative and astounding mix of warm-hearted period drama and
epic fantasy, is the labour of love from acclaimed videoclip and feature film director
Tarsem Singh ( The Cell ). It’s a stunning experience for its sheer originality, ambition
and concept. Shot in more than 23 different countries, from Turkey to Cambodia to
Chile to Prague, it dazzles the eye and enthrals the mind. From underwater shots of
elephants swimming and massed Sufi dancers to Brothers Quay-type animation,
The Fall is stuffed with amazing sights. This aesthetically sumptuous experience
stars Lee Pace ( The Good Shepherd ), Justine Waddell ( Mansfield Park, Dracula
2000, Thr3e ), Daniel Caltagirone ( The Beach, The Four Feathers, After ) and
Leo Bill ( 28 Days Later, The Living and the Dead )."

decide to take a low-rent sight-seeing trip of Northern Australia’s mangrove swamps. Their
tour is interrupted when something overturns their boat and the guide disappears. After taking
refuge in some nearby trees, they discover that the cause of the accident is none other than
an enormous, ferocious crocodile. Surrounded by water and with nothing to eat, they face the
painful decision of how to cross the river in the overturned boat, knowing that the crocodile
lurks somewhere beneath the murky waters, waiting to turn them into lunch.
Anyone who has seen Wolf Creek, knows the remote outlying areas of Australia can
be a pretty frightening place. This is proven again in Black Water, a solid piece
of survival horror, reminiscent of Open Water, that has no need for any special
effects to raise tension to unsuspected limits. The crocodile, the villain of the
piece, is definitely one of the impressive things in Black Water. It looks highly
realistic, right down to the way it moves over and above water. Based on
a true story, directors Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich’s nerve-wrecking
adventure revolves around an all-too-real life-threatening dilemma. The
sudden reptilian attacks and the desperate attempts of the trio to get back
to their submerged boat raise potent apprehension and imaginatively
stretch the suspense to nail-biting levels. The stylish visuals, in
particular, a midnight nightmare, pay terrific shock dividends too."

case in which a doctor killed his wife. It was big news at the time, because the murderer
was a well known professor working for a famous medical institute in Bangkok. As Chalinee
researches the case, she discovers two other murders that share many similarities to the
first one. 8 years before, a medical student killed his girlfriend in a fit of jealousy and sliced
her body into small pieces. In another case that happened forty years before, a nurse was
murdered by her own lover, a doctor. What made these men kill their loved ones ? Why
were they all medical professionals and why was there so much passion and hatred in
their relationships ? And the most disturbing question of all, why did all these murders
take place in the same house ?
The House by Monthon Arayangkoon, director of the Thai box-office smash The
Victim, is a refreshing addition to the ghost movie genre. Apparently based
on a true story, The House is crammed full of spectral appearances. It’s
got many clever twists and turns, good cinematography, an effective
soundtrack and lots of scary special effects. And let’s not forget
lead actress Inthira Chaloenpura ( The Unborn, The Legend of King
Naresuan ), who’s our guide in this chilling and thrilling ghost ride."

died tragically in a car accident. Today is the last day she has to spend at home before going to
hospital to induce labour. The calm is interrupted by a knock on the door. Confronted by a mysterious
woman, Sarah is immediately suspicious, and refuses to let her in. However, she will not leave. Sarah
suddenly feels afraid and calls the police. In the gloom outside, the woman watches her through the
picture windows. Yet, when the police shows up, she’s gone. With riots raging in the neighbouring
suburb, the distracted policemen confront her and leave. Sarah locks herself away in her house,
unaware that the woman is now inside. As Sarah feels her first contractions, she does all she can
to fight back this scissor-wielding madwoman hell bent on taking one thing... her baby.
A l’Intérieur is the terrific debut of young French directors-writers Alexandre Bustillo and
Julien Maury, that gives American torture porn like Saw or Hostel a run for its money. Editor
Baxter and composer François-Eudes Chanfrault, both also involved with Alexandre Aja’s
Haute Tension, deliver jack-knife edits and a pulsating score that hits nerve-shattering
notes. The insane menace of the madwoman, played by Beatrice Dalle ( Betty
Blue, Time of the Wolf, Clean ) and the determined survival of Sarah, a part
of Alysson Paradis ( The Last Day, Fracasses) , involve highly physical
and exhausting performances. They drive the narrative forward with
gut-wrenching force, tapping into a primal fright factor."

hardly brings any fish home. The people in the village have turned their backs on him and
his beloved son Jonas. Nonetheless, they lead a happy life in a small fishing hut by the sea. One
stormy night Helge sets out to fulfil an old mysterious dream: To bring back “the silver of the
heavens”, a large catch for his starving son, but he never returns. Thereupon little Jonas Block
has to undergo the painful hardships of poverty, puritan austerity and loss. Slowly the little boy
loses his smile and starts to embitter. But then a little miracle happens at the magical place
where the heavens and the sea become one.
First-time feature director Toke Constantin Hebbeln has crafted a mysterious, magical fable
so classic in its telling that one might believe it based on an ancient myth. Rounding out
this fanciful tale are a pair of moving performances by young Leonard Proxauf and veteran
Rolf Becker ( The Lost Honour of Katherina Blum, Gloomy Sunday ) as his father. Capped by
beautiful cinematography by Felix Novo de Oliveira, Nevermore fits nicely in the vain of
recent pictures like The Illusionist and The Prestige. Nevermore encourages you to believe
that magic can happen when you need it most."

One day, a hitman kills her father and kidnaps the young couple. Tim is tortured, but manages to

by the assassin into believing that he’s her saviour. The man marries Maruzzella and trains her
to become a professional killer. Now, ten years later, while carrying out a mission, Maruzzella
and Tim cross paths again.
Harun Hazar graduated with honours from the Cologne Academy of Media Arts with his endwork
Present. The movie is a continuation of his short film Gift, which already told a part of the story.
Hazar has realised a remarkable homage to film noir. All the elements are there; the femme
fatale, the trapped man and the menacing atmosphere, but he takes the movie to a fantastic
level where dream and reality intertwine."

Rent, No Utilities is another low-budget gem from a German film academy. Gregor Buchkremer
has made one hell of a calling card with this impressive mood piece. Each of the flat mates
has reasons to feel vexed by their fellow student, but the more he’s absent, the more he’s
present in their minds. With subttle use of stylistic means, Buchkremer creates an eerie
atmosphere and tops his tale with a brilliant surprise ending."

four other long features, but has also honed his skills as a special
effects master on Uwe Boll’s Bloodrayne, Tunnel Rats and Seed. His
latest film, Dard Divorce, will not beat Premutos’ record of 137 victims,

factory job and trying to find work while living off welfare with his grotesquely obese and chronically
unfaithful wife. Just outside of Paradise lives his uncle Dave, the con man leader of a fake religious
cult. Unknown to his faithful followers, uncle Dave hasn’t been paying his taxes and his private little
kingdom is now in danger of being shut down. Following an absurdly demeaning job interview and
a trip to the welfare office gone horribly and hysterically wrong, our hero agrees to help uncle
Dave on a scam to clear his financial sheet. At the same time, Osama Bin Laden and his
core of Al Quaeda members are hiding in Paradise. They’re preparing an attack even
more devastating than 9/11 and the key to their plan involves the same essential
ingredient as that of uncle Dave’s.
Postal might be based on a video game, but this is certainly not your typical Uwe Boll
film. Postal is one of the most vulgar and offensive comedies ever put to celluloid,
a crudely uproarious, positively hilarious satire of post 9/11 America, religious
extremism, conspiracy theories and much, much more. Besides offending and
entertaining its audience, the movie also features some pointed and accurate
moments of social satire. Nothing is too sacred or to crude for Boll, who also
mercilessly puts himself through the mangler. Postal, the mutant offspring of
the Farrelly Brothers, South Park and Troma, is a manic, tasteless comedy,
which alone for its opening and closing scene, will never be released
anywhere in the US of A."

comfortable summer retreat. Stopping by their nearest neighbours, Fred and Betsy
Thompson, in the rich gated community, they notice the couple has two young male guests and
seem curiously distant. Fred comes around with one of his guests, Paul, whom he describes
as the son of a business associate, to help George launch his refitted boat. Meanwhile, the
other guest, Peter, comes to the house to ask Anna if he can borrow some eggs. Even though
both youths are extremely polite, they progressively stretch the unwritten rules of social
behavior to the limits. When George finally cracks and slaps one of them in the face, the
“games” begins in earnest.
Michael Haneke’s own remake of his controversial 1997 film, is as provocative and
deliberately manipulative as the original. The acclaimed director of The Piano
Player, The Time of the Wolf and Hidden has successfully transposed his
theme of the relationship between violence and the media from Europe
to the U.S. Funny Games is a horrifying and shocking exercise about
the desensitizing effects of violence on society. Tim Roth ( Reservoir
Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Planet of the Apes ) and a sensational Naomi Watts
( Mulholland Drive, King Kong, The Ring ) play the tortured couple,
while Michael Pitt ( Last Days ) and Brady Corbet ( Thunderbirds ) are
chillingly convincing as the two young psychopaths."

an angelic politeness and an easy cool that belie his young age. And now, he seems increasingly
unhappy with his new life in which his parents dote on Lily while he quietly plays the piano in
the corner. The mood starts to darken in the Cairn’s apartment. Lily cries incessantly and an
upstairs renovation drives Abby almost insane. Stressed to the limit and living on no sleep,
Brad and Abby find themselves wrapped up in an escalating chain of domestic terror. But
what is the cause of their torment ? Is it all a series of eerie coincidences or are they in
the midst of an unimaginably evil mind ?
George Ratliff, who previously directed the documentary Hell House, successfully
transitions to narrative features with a horror story disguised as a sophisticated
family drama. Eschewing dark shadows and recherché camera angles, he
compensates for the sinister content by favouring daylight over night-time and
preserving a straightforward, natural approach that defies expectations. Thanks
to complex performances from a top-notch cast, including Sam Rockwell
( The Green Mile, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind ), Vera Farmiga ( The
Departed, Running Scared ) and Jakob Kogan as the child prodigy, Joshua
transcends the genre to create a modern horror story that demonstrates
how the potential for evil exists in the everyday."

Math and murder combine to time-honoured effect in The Oxford Murders.
Festival favourite Alex de la Inglesia ( The Day of the Beast, Perdita Durango,

us with a solid and entertaining whodunit, full of philosophical bantering,
games-playing and many references to Hitchcock, Sleuth and The Usual

lecture halls, dark, impressive libraries and cluttered lodgings, albeit littered
with quite a few corpses. John Hurt ( The Elephant Man, 1984 ) and Elijah

Prachya Pinkaew aboard as co-producer, allowing what should have been
a subversive, no-budget underground film to be made on the scale of

brains and brawn of the operation, and Peter, his wet blanket brother. Tied and gagged in the
trunk outside is Tracey, a spunky youngster with a rich and worried father back home. Things go
the wrong way pretty quickly when Tracey’s scheming step-brother Andrew turns up and sours
the get-together, leading to a merry chase through the nearby woods. It’s an excursion which is
destined to end in a bloodbath for some or all of those involved. Because deep in the woods is
another cottage, home to a psychopathic maniac and his trusty pickaxe.
The Cottage is about as far removed from Paul Andrew Williams’ debut feature, the harrowing
and distressing drama From London to Brighton, as possible. It’s a relentless dark horror
comedy with an extreme twist. Made in the best “Evil Dead” tradition, tongues are rammed
firmly in cheek while metal is being rammed firmly in flesh. Laughs take first priority
here, and the subsequent lashings of gore only add to the humour. Every sliced limb
and broken bone only serves to ramp up the excitement. There’s an emphasis on
character that is quite remarkable for the genre. Reece Shearsmith ( TV’s
The League of Gentlemen, Shaun of the Death ) and Andy Serkis ( Lord of

Epitaph, the feature debut of directing brothers Bum-sik Jung and Sik Jung,
blends stunning visuals with a rich, intricately-fashioned soundtrack. Their
tale touches on themes such as love beyond death and schizophrenia,
while putting plenty of shivers down the audience’s spine. The Jung

On Evil Grounds is not just another addition to the low-budget torture porn genre, meaning

apartment and got brushed off by social services. Now he has to spend the night in the
park. But the police chases him away. Brandi, a dedicated retirement-home caregiver who
devotes far too much of her free time to partying, drinking and drugs, is on her way home.
Tom winds up in the wrong place at the wrong time when he crosses the street just as Brandi
puts pedal to the metal. She’s understandably upset when Tom’s broken body flies through
her windshield. Still, she has sufficient presence of mind to drive home and stow her car in
her garage. If she doesn‘t want to lose her job, she has to get rid of the body. But there’s
a complication. Tom is still alive. And the longer he remains stuck in the windshield, the
more time he has to gather strength for the slow and painful process of escape.
Inspired by a real-life incident, Stuck is ingeniously nasty and often shockingly
funny, as it incrementally worsens a very bad situation. Coming from Bifff
favorite Stuart Gordon ( Re-Animator, From Beyond, Space Truckers ), this
darkly comical farce includes lots of quease-inducing scenes of bloody
mayhem and suffering, but is more unsettling and hilarious when the
violence is emotional, as Brandi gradually reveals the full measure
of her psychopathic selfishness. With pitch-perfect performances by
Mena Suvari ( American Beauty, American Pie ) as Brandi and Stephen
Rea ( The Crying Game, Citizen X, V For Vendetta ) as Tom, Stuck is a
brilliant, sardonic piece of reality horror."

entity from another world. The next day, at the local school, the kids are not really impressed
to learn that they’ll get a new substitute teacher. But Ulla Harms is more than they bargained
for. She’s a tough, sneering dictator and master of take-no-prisoners psychological games
who announces she can bend them to her will and proves her point with unearthly
methods of mind control. It turns out she’s an alien investigating the mystery of
love to save her planet, where inhabitants devour each other after mating. Ulla
has no problems at all to manipulate all the adults around her. It will be up to
the kids to save them from the terror of the alien substitute.
All children know that teachers are weird, but what if it turned out that they’re
extra-terrestrially weird ? This premise is used to yield highly enjoyable
results in Ole Bornedal’s The Substitute. The director of Nightwatch
efficiently mixes thrills with social comedy, the humor playing on the
differences between child and adult perceptions. Star of The Substitute
is undoubtedly Paprika Steen ( The Idiots, Adam‘s Apples ), who plays
Ulla as a mercurial monster of a woman, slipping unpredictably from
cackling witch to icy disciplinarian to surrogate mum, sometimes within
a single shot. Add to her exuberant performance some first rate special

Eden Log is a truly original and visually very impressive sci-fi horror flic from France. First

bewildered yet resourceful hero to explore, impressively incarnated by Clovis Cornillac ( A
Very Long Engagement, The Tiger Brigades, Asterix at the Olympic Games ). The grey color
scheme gives Eden Log a very dirty and raw feeling. It possesses a haunting atmosphere

Matthew Hope’s directorial debut The Vanguard presents a fresh approach

The Aerial, the second feature from Argentina’s Esteban Sapir, is an amazing spectacle

no memories about his actions as a ghost and certainly doesn’t know how he became one. But
he does know he’s been around for quite a while. However, doing some soul-searching requires
you need to have memories to draw on. The ghost strikes a deal with the Man, an afterlife
God who can show him the origin of his existence. But that also implies that he will fade into
oblivion once the memories start coming back : about him playing tricks with humans, about
his love for a runaway female ghost right down to the memory of the fatal event that explains
his spectral condition.
I Against Ghost is an almost one-man experimental movie shot entirely on mini-dv by former
film critic Jo Smets, starring Smets himself and EvelIne Vincke, and the first Belgian film
we’ve ever presented in the 7th Orbit. And it rightly deserves its place in, what we call,
our “discovery section”. I Against Ghost is an experience you have to be willing to
immerse yourself into. The slow, grainy images, the morbid spectral voice-over and the
hypnotic, pulsating soundtrack will put you right into the mind of a ghost wrestling
with his existential crisis. This is truly independent filmmaking at its best,
transcending the barriers between the surreal and the supernatural and
between a viewing experience and a performance. I Against Ghost is a

Head Under Water starts out as a small town murder mystery, but then enters
more darker and Kafkaesque grounds. The first feature by German helmer
Andreas Kleinert since his well-received 1999 drama Paths in the Night,

social conventions. And in life, you have to compromise certain parts
of your soul to fit in, until you ultimately lose all that is good.” Shot in

In his long feature debut Love Runs Faster Than Blood, Japanese director Hideki Kitagawa,
a professor at the Tokyo College of Visual Arts and amateur painter and designer, examines
a desperate love affair that is consumed to the limit. It’s exquisitely shot, every scene
imbued with a magnetic beauty. Love Runs Faster than Blood is composed of
dark settings that are almost unperceivable to the eye of the spectator, which
depict the darkest and most daring moments of the characters, while the
sparse moments of brightness mark the passages to freedom, which
are equally rare. Kitagawa tells his story with very few cuts and brought
dialogue to a minimum to add more value to the images, underscored by
music from Aphex Twin and from Jaques Demy’s La Baie des Anges."

Nobody is a neo-noir nightmare with superb acting, cinematography, art direction,

A Nocturne is a philosophical vampire film by Melbourne-based independent filmmaker Bill
Mousoulis. After having directed several acclaimed art-films, Mousoulis has made his first genre
film and with stunning results. Just like in Abel Ferrara’s The Addiction, A Nocturne doesn’t
focus on stakes, crucifixes or deadly daylight, but radically reworks and subverts the rules of
the genre. He presents us with a modern, realistic and recognizable setting. His protagonists
are outsiders, people on the edge, struggling with their condition and society. A Nocturne is a
wildly original and thought-provoking experience with ingenious visuals, editing and music.
Alex Spears and Vanessa de Largie are impressive as the vampire couple, emanating the
film’s spirit and ideas by their distinctive, zombie-like gait to their solemn expressions."

disease that, according to the media, has arrived in the city from the Amazon jungle. Whoever
is attacked by the virus, dies a few days later as the body is totally covered by a second skin
of voracious bacteria. Horrified, José tries to commit suicide. At the very moment of aiming
a gun at his mouth, the neighbourhood is shaken by the violent explosion of a bomb. That
night and during the ensuing days, José discovers replica’s of himself, as if his sick ego
has endlessly multiplied itself. All his clones are infected with the same virus
and are killing each other in fratricide fights. All of them are equally cruel in
their attempts to exterminate one another and they all seek to justify why the
others should die.
Columbia doesn’t seem to be an easy place to live, being plagued by drug
lords, revolutionary armies, paramilitary dead squads and rampant crime. This
certainly provides plenty of inspiration to its artists. Director Oscar Campo
and producer Alina Hleap have realised a courageous film that provides
a fascinating mix of the fantastic, the political and the psychological.
In Others, the theme of replication is an allegory for Columbia today,
a country possessed by dark forces that it has created itself; daily
neurosis, homicidal madness and atrocity in its purest state. The film
is also about the globalization of culture, in which identities merge into
one. The modern ego is disintegrated into a thousand fragments that
all become miniaturized ego’s, dreaming of resembling themselves."

In its unsettling blend of visual and aural disturbances and eruptions, including some radical
strobe effects, Pop Skull seems to have invented a new subgenre : acid horror. Directorcameraman-
editor and co-writer Adam Wingard constructs a subjective universe that
places viewers almost entirely inside the frazzled mind of Daniel. Pop Skull
is a distinctive, visually powerful and uncompromising look at a disturbed,
alienated young man battling inner demons while trying to make some
human connections with the outside world. Lead-actor and co-writer
Lane Hughes makes a large contribution on the script and as Daniel, a
role reported to be autobiographical, gives a performance that amounts
to a slow meltdown in front of the camera."

psychological disorder that threatens him ? Or perhaps an inexplicable natural
phenomenon, a time warp that pulls him in, deeper and deeper ?
Groundhog Dag Meets David Lynch in Tale 52. Somewhere between the lines
of a psychological drama and a fantasy thriller, it’s a bizarre tale about the
end and the beginning of an affair. Director Alexis Alexiou has blown up
his 16mm stock to 35mm to obtain a grainy look. He uses multiple shots
from different angles to increase the sense of paranoia. Daylight is shut
out entirely from Iasonas’ dingy, colourless apartment, almost the only
location in the movie. Alexiou entirely forgoes a linear narrative to plunge
us into a first hand experience of a surreal psychotic breakdown. Tale
52 is an elliptical mind bender that takes us on a trip to a truly dark and
confusing world that would have made Philip K. Dick proud."

out of nowhere with a sledgehammer and kills them. There are a few simple rules that must
be followed if the hammer is to be avoided; silence, obedience, tolerance, yielding and having

against each other, already frazzled nerves shatter and a killing fest starts, involving
knives, poison, guns, a chainsaw and a nail gun.
The Virgin Suicides meets Battle Royale in 36 Steps, a camp and kooky teen
horror flick from Argentina’s Adrian Garcia Bogliano, the appraised director
of Rooms for Tourists. This surprisingly effective slasher flick layers familiar
horror motifs with a critique of women’s oppression, albeit accompanied by
lots of bikini shots and tons of graphic violence. 36 Steps, remarkably made
with no money at all, yet full of amazing effects and high production values,
is innovative, alive, funny and absolutely terrifying."

evaluate their ideas about tolerance, identity politics and the future of the human race.
American Zombie unravels and expands into the realm of personal documentary and
horror, providing a fresh take on the zombie movie. The undead we meet are pretty
ordinary folks, albeit troubled by maggots and rotting patches of skin.
They work low-wage jobs and face all kinds of discrimination. Lee and
Solomon make fun of themselves, the pretensions of cinema verité

The Broken, the second feature of talented British director Sean Ellis, is a significant
departure from his charming romantic comedy Cashback. He presents us with a brooding,
atmospheric piece of upscale psychological horror. Ellis effectively maintains a
menacing feeling of dread throughout the entire movie and has you on edge
every time the camera goes near a mirror or reflective surface, visualizing
the film’s latent metaphor about the fear of the self. The production
values are impeccable, especially the sound design and Cashback D.O.P.

defending Japan from all the giant monsters that constantly seem to besiege the country.
Unlike his predecessors, whose achievements were feted with parades and cheering
fans, Daisato’s battles are only broadcast late at night to a rapidly diminishing

Dai-Nipponjin, translated as Big Man Japan, is a wickedly deadpan spin on
the pop image of giant Japanese superheroes. Director and star Hitoshi
Matsumoto, one of Japan’s biggest comedians, has delivered a wacky

Young Chilean horror talent Jorge Olguin visited the Bifff in 2003 to present his vampire

eccentric amateur rocket scientist, whose deeds are dogged by constant ill fortune caused
mostly by a clumsy and decidedly overfed catlike creature called Donci. Their simple existence
suddenly becomes complicated when an unidentified object crashes into their garden. It’s the
Voyager 3, full of images and pictures of a planet called Earth. Egon decides that there is only
one thing to do and that is to establish contact with this distant civilization.
From Hungary comes a visually brilliant and engaging animated adventure by director Adam
Magyar. Our two loveable heroes never knowingly cause any harm to another living being.
Although they often get battered and bruised, it’s only as a result of their own hapless antics.
Egon and Donci never speak on screen, so all communication that takes place between them,
is achieved by a series of childish mimes and simple sound. Add to this stunning visuals
and a heart-warming story with a simple, but poignant message, and you’re guaranteed
to be as thrilled as your little ones."

everything audiovisual. There are no movies at all. Nothing except bizarre TV-shows that are
aired to entertain and instruct the people, especially about the artificial food. In this extremely
bizarre world, there are daredevil filmmakers who wage a celluloid war with stolen camera’s
and lots of creativity. Daniel Vega is shooting one of these films called Rebel Scum,
when he’s arrested by the state police. He manages to dispose of the offending
videotape by dumping it on geeky comic book fan Lucas, who’s slowly sucked
into the deranged world of rebel filmmakers. When the government announces
a “Film of the People” contest, Lucas enlists all his friends for a little healthy
subversion.
Filmatron is a kitsch, dystopian vision from the same bunch of Argentinean
film freaks that brought us Zombie Plague : Mutant Zone in 2003. It’s
a classic high energy, low budget moviemaking, albeit with higher
production values than Zombie Plague. The team of Farsa Produciones
has managed to provide us with an enjoyable and cheesy version
of George Orwell‘s 1984. Walking a tightrope between risibility and
comedy, Filmatron also makes some points about censorship in a
country with lingering memories of dictatorship."

I Know Who Killed Me is a sumptuous and thrilling feast for the senses. Director
Chris Sivertson ( The Lost ), cinematographer John R. Leonetti ( The Mask, The
Scorpion King ) and production designer Jerry Fleming ( The Player, Crank )
have taken their inspiration from suspense masters such as Alfred Hitchcock,
Brian De Palma and Dario Argento. I Know Who Killed me is a deliberately

Boasting amazing special effects and a gripping story that spans three

Monster Slayer is an entertaining tribute to the decade when horror movies were fun.
Director John Knautz and screenwriter John Ainslie have created a wonderful mythology

to please any fan of this genre. Trevor Matthews’ performance as Buffy’s deranged

street. Just as they spy each other, Manli is hit by a car and killed. A year later, Junchu has isolated
himself in his vast family mansion with the mousy, devoted Sansan, whom he’s been forced to marry
by his domineering mom. Rejected by the sickly Junchu, who still longs for Manli, Sansan wanders
around the spooky mansion and starts to get visions of her husband’s dead lover. The ghostly
Manli proposes a deal to Sansan. If she can occasionally enter Sansan’s body, to touch

this spectral pact works out well and Junchu finally starts to take an interest in his
wife. But the closer the two get, the more jealous Manli becomes. Junchu belongs
to her, dead or alive.
The Matrimony, China’s first ghost movie directed by Teng Huatao ( One Hundred, Sky
of Love ), is essentially a tragic love story. Leading this supernatural menage-à-trois
is Leon Lai ( Fallen Angels, Seven Swords ) as Junchu, the man who can’t forget
his true love and lives in a state of denial and guilt. Fan Bingbing ( A Chinese
Tall Story, The Signal ) plays Xu Manli, who now belongs to the netherworld,

Claudio Simonetti. References to the previous instalments circle through
the richly atmospheric plot, complete with bizarre turns of nightmare logic

away with him but she returns home to her husband Lewis. Lewis is arguing with two of his
friends and as she watches Lewis suddenly beats one of them to death with a baseball bat.
She flees to a neighbour’s apartment but everyone in the building has gone crazy and is trying
to kill each other. She realizes that the madness is being caused by strange signals that
are coming through all TV’s, radios and telephones. They’re invading everybody’s
minds. Suddenly struck by the power of the insidious transmissions, they are
compelled to kill or be killed. Complicating matters is a zombie-like resistance
some characters have to the idea of remaining dead. And nobody can be sure
who, inside or outside, has the signal madness.
In The Signal, young American filmmakers David Bruckner, Dan Bush, and
Jacob Gentry offer us a truly original horror experience, ingeniously blending
bloody gore with psychological satire. They tell their eerie tale in three
parts called Transmissions I, II and III, shifting perspectives to draw out
a larger story that explores dark secrets and fears as well as jealousy
and betrayal. Not for the faint of heart, The Signal will nonetheless
satisfy those looking for a smart exploration of the power of media to
mutate our minds. It is truly inspired independent filmmaking that will
stalk viewers from every dark corner while examining the surprising
human madness lying deep within."

group of people, the after party will be a killer. At first, it seems as if random people have
been invited to the 27th floor for an exclusive VIP get together, but they soon find out that they
were invited there for a reason. Trapped on one floor with a masked killer, they’ll have to figure
out the deadly clues that he gives them while also trying to stay alive.
Surviving each floor is the name of the game in Steel Trap, a slasher that’s just as entertaining
as any of the Saw series. What makes it fun is that the trapped party people are a bunch
of very annoying and not very sympathetic media celebrities. Figuring out how each of
them will meet their grisly end is as much part of the game as the one that the masked
killer is playing with them. Steel Trap is the long feature debut of Mexican born writerdirector
Luis Camara and his wife, screenwriter Gabrielle Galanter and stars Georgia
Mackenzie ( The Kovak Box ), Pascal Langdale ( The Phantom of the Opera ),
Annabelle Wallis ( True True Lie ) and Adam Rayner ( Straightheads )."

from his injuries, alone in an empty house, Daniel begins to rebuild his son’s old video
camera that was damaged in the crash. Infused with power from the moment of the accident
as well as Daniel’s overwhelming grief and desire to regain control, the camera develops the
ability to stop time when Daniel presses the pause button. This discovery restores Daniel’s
sense of purpose and he fills the vacuum in his life by taking responsibility for another
victim, Sarah, a young schoolteacher who lost her husband in the same car crash.
At first, he starts to change little things in her life. But Daniel underestimates
the havoc he causes by stopping time. His power becomes an addiction and
slowly, but surely, it starts to corrupt him.
Suspension, by young debuting filmmakers Ethan Shaftel and Alec Joler, is a
compelling fantastic tale about the corruptive nature of power and the dangers
of an obsession with control. This low budget tour-de-force will amaze you
with the sophistication of the time freezing effects and touch you with the
intense portrayals of loss and longing by Scott Cordes as Daniel and
Annie Tedesco as Sarah. The screenplay by Aris Blevins is tight and
suspenseful, while the score, composed by Jed Whedon, brother of Buffy
creator Joss Whedon, adds to the excitement and suspense."

that person passes out. So he usually has to wear white gloves. Somehow, it always rains when
he works. Chiba has never seen a blue sky. His job is to determine whether the human that is
going to die is ready for the afterlife. He has 7 days to examine his target and decide if they
are to live or to die. His current subject is Kazue Fujiki, an office worker in the complaint
department of a manufacturing company. Exhausted after her day, she emerges from her
office. It’s time for the Grim Reaper to go to work.
Wong Kar-Wai regular ( Chungking Express, Fallen Angels ) and House of Flying Daggers

by debut long feature director Masaya Kakehi. His story is set in three different years :

From Kenta Fukasaku, director of Battle Royale II and Yo-Yo Girl Cop, and Oishi

the Tour & Taxis site in two screening theatres, from
27 March till 8 April 2008.
Why are we so tenaciously defending fantastic film,
a genre which, since the birth of cinema, has often
been met with derision and contempt ? Well, if you
really want to know, as programmers and organizers
of the biggest Belgian genre film festival, we’ll
shout it from the rooftops: fantastic film is the most
significant cinema on the planet !
And we’ll prove it for the 26th time with a program
that’s overflowing with young directors bombarding
us with poignant questions about a future that’s not a
century away, but that’s here and now and all around
us : virtual worlds, ecological catastrophes, nanotechnology,
privatized war, genetically manipulates
beasties, extreme reality TV… Where else but at
BIFFF will you get a taste of what’s in store for all of
us ?!
As usual, we don’t take ourselves too serious and
wrap the festival in a multitude of animations,
exhibitions, side-events and a few surprises along
the way, allowing spectators to browse through our
cinematic pearls in a true, festive manner.
As soon as you’ll enter the site of Tour & Taxis, you’ll
be confronted by a wide array of choices.
Big theatre or small theatre ?
An exhibition or being transformed into an angel or
demon at the make-up stand ?
Having a drink with your friends in the festival bar or
eating something in the BIFFF restaurant ?
Following an interview with one of the numerous
guests or a visit at one of the specialized stands ?
Or just hanging around and enjoying the famous
convivial atmosphere ?
It’s all possible at the 26th BIFFF.
We know, the costs of living keep on rising.
But the BIFFF is not going to plunder your pockets.
We’re not one eurocent more expensive than last
year and many of the activities are free.
So you’d better get ready for a massive 13-day
onslaught of fantasy, horror, sci-fi, cult and thriller at
the most FANTASTIC film festival in Belgium.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fantastic film production. That’s also the reason behind the creation
of the first Workshop in 1996. The ambition of this initiative has
remained unchanged throughout the years: to offer the students of
our film schools the opportunity to gain experience by making three
fantastic short films under the supervision of an experienced foreign
film director. Previous workshops have been supervised by, among
other, Freddie Francis, Lewis Gilbert, Jack Cardiff, Stuart Gordon,
Nick Willing and Anders Ronnow-Klarlund. This year, Bernard Rose
will reveal some of the secrets of his craft to a new generation of
film professionals. The talented Rose, who is currently in pre production
on MR NICE, based on the book by Howard Marks, is best
known for the urban horror classic CANDYMAN. Other feature credits
include IMMORTAL BELOVED, IVAN’S XTC, SNUFF MOVIE, ANNA
KARENINA and PAPERHOUSE, for which Rose won the Golden Raven
at BIFFF in 1989.
Collaborations with professional partners from the audiovisual field
are intended to generate real production conditions within which
the students of RITS and NARAFI can realize three short fantastic
films. Logistical support facilities are provided by Maquillages S.A.,
Eye-lite, Key Grip Systems S.A., APPLE, Double Precision, Building &
Engineering and Rosebud Heritage S.A., while students of LE SITE
( Enseignement Supérieur en Infographie et Technique d’Expression )
in Hornu, under the guidance of SFX specialist Jean-Yves Arboit, are
taking care of the digital postproduction.
During a 8 day shooting & post prod period, the students will have to
realize 3 fantastic shorts at a location that not only has to represent
Brussels, but must also be an inspiration for the films. Shooting
took place from 4 until 6 March at the former Jesuit Monastery in
the heart of Brussels, the results are screened on Friday 4 April at
4.30 pm. Eye Lite will provide one student with a value of 2.500
euro in lightning material for his/her next film project. Thanks to the
collaboration of all partners and the support of the Flemish Community
Commission, the Workshop of the BIFFF has become a valuable
and important tool in the education of our future film makers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

films, ranging from fairytales to outright horror, are proof of the energy and creative
force of contemporary German cinema.
This is the first time that the Goethe-Institut Brüssel participates to the Bifff and
promotes a cinematographically very rich genre that we don’t yet know very well. For
this important première, we’ve wanted to accentuate the diversity by inviting young
or already experienced directors to Brussels, all graduates from the various German
film schools.
In the program, a special discovery night will be dedicated to them. After the screenings,
the festival will organize a meeting with the filmmakers. This encounter will give
the visitors and fans of the BIFFF the occasion to take a peak behind the scenes…
