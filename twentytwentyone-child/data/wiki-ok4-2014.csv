but charismatic college professor, recruits
some of his students with an open mind to participate in a
unique experiment: the creation of a poltergeist. Crucial for the
success of the undertaking is Jane Harper, a seriously mentally
disturbed girl who will serve as the catalyst. Coupland hires
cameraman Brian McNeill to film the events. It goes without
saying that the experiment will seriously go off the rails. Those
who want to destroy the barriers between the living and the
dead will have to pay a heavy price.
The supernatural thriller The Quiet Ones, the feature film debut
by scriptwriter John Pogue (US Marshalls, Ghost Ship), drew
its inspiration from a true event that transpired in the 70ties
when a poltergeist went on a rampage. The film was shot in a
very creepy and atmospheric mansion in England, the perfect
setting for the first horror film by the revamped Hammer Film
Studios. Starring Jared Harris (Lincoln, Sherlock Holmes: A Game
of Shadows) as professor Coupland, newcomer Olivia Cooke as
Jane and Sam Claflin (Snow White & The Huntsman) as the man
who has to capture it all on film."

mankind decided to seek for a new home among the
stars. They searched in vain and had to return to their old planet,
only finding their way barred by the Gaia Coalition, an alien
alliance that closed off the Earth from its former inhabitants.
But one man resisted; the mysterious space pirate Captain Harlock.
This merciless but honorable revolutionary can count on
his battle cruiser Arcadia, the support of fierce warrior Kei and
the council of the alien Mimay to conquer the Earth. Ezra, the
military leader of the Alliance, orders his brother Logan to kill
Harlock. He infiltrates the crew of the Arcadia, ready to make
an end to the pirate’s life. But Logan becomes impressed by
Harlock’s crusade and turns his back on Gaia. The web of lies
spun around our planet starts to unravel. An epic battle will
decide the fate of humanity.
Finally we’ll be able to see the famous anime classic by Leiji
Matsumoto (Galaxy Express 999, Space Battleship Yamato) on
the big screen. Director Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed) had a budget
of 30 million dollars to bring this epic space opera to live in all
its glory. Not only the old, nostalgic for the series that colored
their youth, will enjoy this. Their kids will also be impressed
by this impressive piece of sci-fi animation that benefits from
such a sense of detail that even James Cameron would approve."

are being held hostage. Among them are policeman
Zhong Wen and his daughter Miao Miao, and several

bar owner Wu Jiang. His only demand is the release of a longterm
prisoner. What motive is worth this risk? The prisoner is
brought to the scene of the crime, but the police now face an
even greater crisis, as a cold case is re-opened. Cold is the mind
of the policeman, decisively using his wits to resolve the crisis;
his mission is to find the truth. Cold is the blood of the criminal,
calmly carrying out his evil plan for his revenge. Cold are the
hearts of uncaring people, reacquainted only to pay the ultimate
price for their selfishness; their lives. Cold are the facts that
prove to the rebellious Miao Miao through her extreme ordeal
the love between a father and a daughter.
This grim and intense reboot of the successful Police Story
franchise was directed by Sheng Ding (who already worked
with Jackie Chan in Little Big Soldier). You could describe it as
a mix between Die Hard and an Agatha Christie mystery, in
which action legend Jackie Chan not only gets the chance to
stunt but also to deliver one of the finest performances of his
impressive career."

feel exited about something. He decides to go find Mr. Clair.
When the two identical men meet, their lives get intertwined
in a weird and irrevocable way.
This gorgeous adaptation of The Double, the 2002 novel by
Nobel Laureate José Saramago, breathes new life into the
doppelganger genre. The sweeping, surreal approach by Canadian
director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies, Prisoners) confirms
his reputation as one of the most talented contemporary
filmmakers. There’s something sinister lurking under the slick
surface of things in Enemy. The dark dreams and motives of
the protagonists slowly seep through to reality and turn the
truth into a lie. With Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Brokeback

friend from High School who now makes his money breaking
people’s arms if they don’t pay off their debts. As Craig prepares

of drinks with a very wealthy hipster couple. Colin wants to
celebrate his beautiful wife Violet’s birthday, by taking her to
the seedier side of town. In order to amuse themselves, Colin
engages them all in a series of innocuous bar bets and challenges.
Whoever can drink a shot quickest makes fifty bucks,
whoever can get a bar patron to slap them gets a hundred…
and it continues on like that, with the challenges increasing
in both money and outrageousness, because Colin and Violet
know no limits.
Cheap Thrills was one of last year’s darlings on the festival
circuit and rightly so. This deliciously sadistic comedy thriller
from debut director Evan Katz shows in all gory detail how far
we’re willing to go “for a fistful of dollars”. Just when you think
you can’t take it anymore, Katz ups the ante and leads us to
a devastating, intolerable climax. With an excellent script by
Troma writer Trent Haaga and stand out performances from
Pat Healy ( Ghost World ) and Ethan Embry ( Harold & Kumar )
as Craig and Vince and from David Koechner ( Anchorma ) and
Sara Paxton ( The Innkeepers ) as Colin and Violet."

The futuristic Chinese techno-thriller Control is a dazzling game
of manipulation and deceit. Director Kenneth Bi (The Drummer,

You’d better cut your nails before watching Espectro if you don’t
want to risk biting off your fingers from the unbearable tension
and terror that director Alfonso Pineda Ulloa inflicts upon us.
That’s how scary this Mexican ghost thriller actually is. Luckily
there’s beauty among all the horror thanks to the performance
of the gracious Paz Vega ( Lucia y el Sexo, The Spirit ). The only
thing is that you definitely don’t want to be in her shoes."

and begins studying physics under his grandfather, and Gabriel’s
mentor, Sal. The family enjoys a tenuous stability, until the day
that Sal discovers some of Gabriel’s old project files and traces their
contents back to his place of disappearance. Erol initially wants to
leave the past behind him, until another tragedy propels him to
follow Gabriel’s research to its staggering conclusion, even though
it may mean saying goodbye to everything he’s come to cherish.
The best genre films are usually not those that only consist of
special effects, expensive sets or futuristic technology. They’re the
ones that use those elements to make us care about the problems,
trials and tribulations of real people. Richie Mehta’s I’ll Follow You
Down is one of those films. He uses time travel shenanigans as a
metaphor for how you deal with loss and insecurity, always wanting
to know if the grass was really greener on the other side of the
hill. And he has a terrific cast to draw us into this moving story.
Rufus Sewell ( Dark City, The Illusionist ) is Gabe, Gillian Anderson
( The X-Files, The Fall ) plays Marika and Haley Joel Osment ( the
now grown-up kid from The Sixth Sense ) is Erol."

11 years after a series of incredibly traumatic events
in which he was an active participant. His older sister Kaylie is
there to greet him with open arms and with the news that she’s
made all the preparations necessary to destroy the object she
believes is truly responsible for the events of their childhood:
an antique mirror with a storied history. As Kaylie and Tim spar
over the nature of the ordeal they endured and its true nature,
we flash back to the period preceding the incident, with their
parents exhibiting increasingly erratic and abusive behavior.
Oculus is a slow burn film with a deliciously creepy mood, yet at
the same time it remains exhilarating throughout. This is simply
a great film. It’s not often that we can have an inanimate object
be the subject of as much dread, and when it’s pulled of as
effectively as this, it’s time to celebrate. The taught action, the
floating camera work, and the sense of coolness that’s pervasive
in the film is intoxicating. Visually, Oculus is extremely strong.
Like the mirror itself, the images suck us in. Performance wise,
the ensemble is uniformly excellent. Katee Sackhoff (Battlestar
Gallactica) and Rory Cochrane (Argo) may have the most
recognizable faces as the parents, but the rest of the ensemble
are more than up to tell this tale with a great deal of conviction."

Alex De La Iglesia has done it again. Witching and Bitching is
a deliciously irreverent horror comedy stuffed with hilarious
scenes, mayhem, blood and gore. Do not expect a profound
analysis of contemporary male-female relations. Get ready for
a highly unequal confrontation between a bunch of miserable

down to his basement. He puts on a sound dampening headphone
and launches the frequency. The results are stunning.
What if you could control other people without them realizing
it? LFO or Low Frequency Oscillation, is a true gem for our 7th
Orbit section, the discovery section of the BIFFF. The second
feature by Swedish director Antonio Tublen is a cynical masterpiece
that combines megalomaniac fantasies with dry wit
in a unique universe where everything is possible."

hold her off. With undiminished rage, she goes into the room
of their teenage son and cuts off his penis. She then leaves the
house, without a trace of guilt or sorrow on her face.
And this is just the beginning of the latest masterpiece by Korean
iconoclast Ki-duk Kim. We don’t want to reveal more, just that
the worst hasn’t even started yet. This is clearly not the Ki-duk
Kim of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring and Breath.
Moebius falls into the category of The Isle ( Golden Raven 1999 )
and Pieta ( BIFFF 2013 ), but even more cruel and extreme. This
film hits you like a hammer to the head and plays like a mix
between A Serbian Film and a Greek tragedy. Never before has
the theme of sexual violence been depicted in such a raw and
visceral way. That not a word is spoken during the entire film
further strengthens the impact of what the protagonists inflict
upon each other. Moebius is definitely not a film for sensitive
souls, but those who dare will experience one of the most
memorable viewing experiences of the year."

nobody pays much attention. After a while they find the perfect

different places with torn clothes and bleeding wounds. There’s
not a trace of Maxim to be found. After they have wandered
for a while, they find a house with the stove still burning. Bit
there’s nobody home.
The Outing, by Swiss director Mathieu Seiler, is a grim and dark
fairytale for adults, the kind of film that shreds the borders
between dream and reality, where a sinister atmosphere constantly
lurks beneath the surface. Seiler brings many influences
to The Outing, ranging from the Brothers Grimm to slasher and
Giallo. This is the kind of fairy tale that will keep your eyes open
till dawn because you’ll be too afraid to close them."

you’ll always be in the right place at the right time. But if you are
low frequency, every natural law will conspire against you. Marie
is super-high frequency, Isaac is ultra-low. Nature should ensure
that they never cross paths. Yet they do. Every year they get to
spend exactly one minute together before nature dramatically
intervenes. Over the years it becomes an obsession for Zak to
change his frequency and be with Marie. What he discovers may
allow him to realize his dream, but will change everything we
know about ourselves and our destinies ; forever.
OXV The Manual gives you lots to think about: philosophy, determinism,
physics, free will and the laws of time and nature.
But it is most of all an incredibly intelligent piece of scifi. Director
Darren Paul Fisher transforms a philosophical and scientific love
story into an allegory about social class and mass manipulation.
After the premiere at Fantasia Montréal, some people called it
the best science-fiction film of the millennium. There are still
a few years to go before the next one, but for now we wholeheartedly
agree."

With this long version of his eponymous awarded short feature
from 2011, young Canadian director Craig Goodwill gives visionaries
like Terry Gilliam and Jean-Pierre Jeunet a run for their

After getting noticed in 2006 with his first short feature Angel,
Nikolas List successfully transfers to the long feature division.
Tombville plays like a feverish dream in which David Lynch’s

on the senses, shot partly in the caves of Tour & Taxis, BIFFF’s

kinds of services against payment in cash or blowjobs. He also
deals marihuana on the side, with his clients getting their stuff
stashed in the stomachs of dead rats. Duke considers himself to
be a true music lover. One day he takes a teenager to his apartment

really appreciate Duke’s teachings and runs away. He fires a
few shots at the fleeing ungrateful, but manages to hit one
of his neighbors. A murder in L.A.! Nobody knows what to do.
After the monosyllabic gems Steak, Rubber and Wrong, Quentin
Dupieux dares to deliver a film with two words in the title! Just
like its illustrious predecessors, Wrong Cops is an absurd and
surrealist mosaic that clearly carries the mark of its enigmatic
and willful maker. Dupieux’s politically incorrect films always
go against the stream, perverting and turning upside down the
pillars of our society. With a remarkable guest appearance of
Marilyn Manson as a semi-autistic adolescent."

itself on her journey back home.
The films of Nick Cassavetes ( John Q, Alpha Dog ) do not seem to
have much in common with the intimate drama’s of his legendary
father. He co-wrote the script for Yellow together with his
wife Heather Wahlquist, who also plays the part of Mary. Yellow
is a feast for the eyes and the mind, with its sumptuous visuals,
the politically incorrect themes, many memorable scenes and
a stunning cast: Sienna Miller ( Stardust, G.I. Joe ), David Morse

these secrets have direct consequences not only on their lives;

Hungarian director Zsolt Bernath must have developed a taste
for the BIFFF. After last year’s In The Name of Sherlock Holmes,
he’s already back with Aura, a science-fiction film that reunites
the cast of Sherlock. With its mixture of metaphysics, tension

Lord of Tears, the second feature of young Scottish director

Mikkel Braenne Sandemose’s previous film, Cold Prey 3, was

It’s also a homage to the fantasy spectacles from the 80ties, as

hearing and seeing him. This is the start of an unusual relationship.
Douglas and Audrey share the same pain and they try to
heal each others wounded heart. But there are forces that want
to disturb their bond.
From volunteer at the BIFFF to one of the few female creative
forces in genre cinema; Axelle Carolyn has come a long way. After
three well received shorts, she delivers her first long feature,
produced by Gilles Daoust (The Room) and Neil Marshall (The
Descent). Soulmate is an original and moving ghost story with
everything in place: a heavy atmosphere, beautiful camerawork
and good pacing and structure. This is a film about grief and
loss, about letting go and about obsession, crystallized in the
strong performance of Anna Walton (Hellboy II: The Golden
Army, Mutant Chronicles) as Audrey. Tom Wisdom (300, Pirate
Radio) is Douglas."

career is about to start in Buenos Aires. His client is a
powerful and corrupt civil servant and there’s lots of money to
be gained. Saying that Sebastian’s a bit stressed, is quite the
understatement. He just has time to pass by his ex-wife Dalia to
pick up his two kids for school. As always they insist on descending
the seven flights of stairs on foot and then race their father
to the elevator. It’s their little game and Sebastian willingly
participates because it pisses off Dalia. But this time, there’s
no trace of them to be found on the ground floor. Harassed
by increasingly urgent phone calls from the court, Sebastian
is absolutely not in the mood to play hide and seek with his
offspring. Soon he begins to realize that they never made it
downstairs. It’s as if they went up in smoke. Then his mobile
rings again, and this time it’s not the court.
The first long feature of Patxi Amezcua disposes of all the right
thrills and chills: ever increasing tension, a diabolical pace which
reminds you of films like John Badham’s Nick of Time or Polanski’s
Frantic, a hefty dose of contagious paranoia and the dream
cast of Ricardo Darin ( The Secret In Their Eyes, Nine Queens )
and the magnificent Belen Rueda ( The Orphanage, Julia’s Eyes )."""

Ghost Pain and Ghost Whisper. Both directed by Kazuchika Kise,

If there’s something that makes contemporary Korean cinema so
fascinating, it’s the enthusiasm with which directors mix, mash
up or transform several genres into one movie; ranging from
comedy crime adventure thrillers and melodramatic politically
charged monster films to intimate scifi satire. Intruders, directed
by Young-seok Noh ( Daytime Drinking ) is one of those films. Hidden
under the tense thriller package, hides a full blown political

even mentioned the healthy doses of gore, slasher and murder,
presented with much cinematographic style and flair."

to realize that the trip was a mistake. The house unearths fresh
memories of Liam’s recently deceased mother and the boy
lashes out at Sarah for taking her place. In the course of this
domestic turmoil, it becomes apparent that someone has been
living in the house while they were away. After police inspector
Hawkins reassures them that there is nothing to worry about,
Cory and Sarah decide to stay the night. Big mistake. Their unwanted
house guests have been hiding in the house all along
and take Liam in the middle of the night. Cory and Sarah find
themselves fighting for their lives as they desperately try to get
their son back from the sadistic family of murderers that have
claimed him as their own.
What if Goldilocks and the Three Bears wasn’t a cute fairytale
but a full blown home invasion movie full of gore and terror!?
That’s what Jordan Baker has in store for us with Torment. He
already came to the BIFFF in 2010 with the horror thriller Duress,
but with Torment he has surpassed himself. Katharine Isabelle
( American Mary ) steals the show as a heroic Sarah Morgan.

that you usually don’t care one bit about all those screaming

countries, we decided to turn our 2014 selection into
an exhaustive map of everything that genre cinema can
offer, with a mind boggling program of more than 125
films, including some 104 long features and – an absolute
record – 7 world premières ! ! Here’s a mouth-watering
overview:
– Innovative: the BIFFF offers no less than 23 long feature
debuts from all over the world.
– Chauvinist: the BIFFF is proud to announce 9 Belgian
( co ) productions in its selection: Soulmate, Let me Survive,
Tombville and Ablations, Afterman III, The Miracle
of Life, Ludo, Act Vanished, Dr. Loiseau.
– Eagerly awaited: as usual the BIFFF offers many genre
pearls such as Witching and Bitching, Mindscape, Killers,
Rigor Mortis, Open Grave, Oculus : a bountiful harvest of
sequels: Hatchet 3, The Raid 2, Wolf Creek 2, Dead Snow:
Red vs Dead, Police Story 2013, Young Detective Dee,
etc. : and a surprise from Sir Lloyd Kaufman who’ll present
in person Return to Nuke ‘em High Vol.1 to celebrate
40 years of Troma Film !
But above all, the BIFFF is about discovery. Our India Focus
( with the very first Indian zombie film ! ) and our spotlight
on Hong Kong cinema will give you another perspective on
these global film industry stalwarts, along with the première
of a series of Asian blockbusters: Cold Eyes, Out of
Inferno, Painted Skin, Shield of Straw, Horror Stories 2 and
space pirate captain harlock ( 2D & 3D ! ).
Another highly expected event is, of course, the FRONTIÈRES
project, a co-production market that is unique in
the world and may prove to be an alternative for Belgian
and European genre professionals in an increasingly globalized
market. Another event for professionals is our tax
shelter conference, which will address the recent and crucial
changes to this fiscal instrument. Open to the public
are our master classes with Tonino Benacquista and Jean-
Pierre Jeunet, a short feature selection by the Madrilenian
MadTerror festival and an avalanche of Q&A sessions with
our many guests. You want some names ? You’ll get them :
Giancarlo Giannini, Terry Gilliam, Mélanie Thierry, George
Sluizer, Franco Nero and genre-icon Caroline Munro, who’ll
join last year’s Barbara Steele among the Knight of the Order
of the Raven !
All these goodies will make you look forward to some very
long nights in April, especially with all the other regular
fixtures of the BIFFF delivering in spades : the Body Painting
and the Make-Up competitions, the Vampire Bal, the
ZOMBIFFF Day & Night, the Cosplay, The ARTBIFFF exhibition
and those weird and wonderful street theatre animations
that make the BIFFF so unique in the world !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

decision.The introduction of this reform will allow to counter the many abuses that
have plagued this fundraising system for years and will also allow for a durable,
efficient, solid and reliable system that can guarantee an economically strong and
artistically diverse audiovisual sector. Casa Kafka Pictures and Roland Rosoux will
assure the transition from one system to the other and will provide you with ample
information about:

release of their first album. We can reassure all the living dead ; the
band has nothing to do with Heaven, except for its name ! They will
plunge you in a twilight-like atmosphere where Nick Cave flirts with
Beth Gibbons on an Angelo Badalamenti soundtrack.
Next : the Frenchies from Cercueil, Hypo &EDH and La Trayeuse Electrique,
who’ll behead all remaining zombies with their badass LP’s !
The show starts at the Café Central from 9pm and, most of all, it’s free !
Every Sunday evening in April, Café Central will extend the ZomBI FFF
Night with zombie flick screenings on the program of their film club.
This year’s theme will evoke one of the darkest periods in our history :
when zombies had nothing better to do than lick Nazi jackboots ! If

Competition and the EuroCosplay selection
“Batman, Sailor Moon and Mario walk into a museum” might sound like
the beginning of a joke but that is just what might be in store for you if
you attend the Cosplay competition hosted at the 32nd edition of the Brussels
International Fantastic Film Festival.
On 13 April, in addition to the hoards of movie lovers, the elegant hallways
of the Center for Fine Arts – Bifff’s new home since 2013 – will also welcome
many colorful Cosplay practitioners.
Cosplay originates from Japan and consists of paying homage to a fictional
character from a movie, video game or comic ( both western and
eastern ) by recreating and wearing the characters costume and recreating
their look. But do not think this is some ordinary fancy dress party.
We’re talking about carefully handcrafted and highly detailed costumes
with according hair styles, make-up and even weapons and accessories.
While sometimes accompanied by plying scenes from the comic, game or
film, most of the attention is centered on the costume rather than on the
interpretation. “Kawai”, as they say !
While Japan can be considered to be Cosplay central, with many competitions,
conventions, festivals and even street parades, the first cosplayer
was actually an American. In 1939, Forest J. Ackerman, author, director,
scriptwriter and creator of the cult-comic Vampirella, attended the SciFi
Convention WorldCon dressed up as “future man” and thus became the
pioneer of a trend that is now sweeping the globe !
Since then, Cosplay has also found its place in “the old world”, with countries
like France, Germany, Russia and Italy hosting events where Cosplay
shows are watched by tens of thousands of people ! Belgium can stand
proud on the international cosplay scene with an ever growing and vibrant
community. That’s why we’re thrilled to welcome the 8th edition of
the BIFFF Cosplay Contest. In addition to being one of the oldest running
Cosplay competitions in Belgium, the festival will pick one lucky cosplayer
to represent Belgium at EuroCosplay London. About 40 selected participants
from 18 European countries will compete at the grand final at the
end of October in London for the title of European Cosplay Champion!
So join us on Sunday 13 April to cheer for our Belgian Cosplayers and for
a chance to meet your fictional heroes in three dimensions!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2014,event,"Masterclass, Masterclass Tonino Benacquista",,Masterclass Tonino Benacquista,"Tonino, Benacquista",,,,"Tonino Benacquista, the prolific writer of novels and comic strips, has seen a lot of his work adapted to the big screen:
Love Bites by Antoine de Caunes, The Black Box by Richard Berry, L’Outremangeur by Thierry Bistini, Holy Money, by our
Belgian friend Maxime Alexandre and, more recently, Malavita by our Knight of the Order of the Raven, Sir Luc Besson. But
the artist is like a chameleon. He scripts a novel by Françoise Sagan for Les Faux-Fuyants and co-writes Read My Lips with
Jacques Audiard (César for Best Screenplay in 2002) He tries his hand at the theatre and dabbles with comic strip. After
L’Outremangeur, he teams up in 2010 with his friend and colleague Daniel Pennac for the 74th adventure of Lucky Luke!
But how do you choose your format, a novel or a short story? How do you switch between the avalanche of words pouring
out of a book and the conciseness of comic-strip text balloons ? So many traps that the man brilliantly manages to evade
while multiplying various artistic experiences with the talent that we know. So, if you’re also teeming with ideas without
really knowing how to exploit them, then there’s a solution for you. Bring our notebooks to our Master Class with Tonino
Benacquista. He’ll be accompanied by Michael Degree (UPCB), cultural editor of L’Avenir and a world class comic strip expert!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

storytelling, having delighted us with pearls such as Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children or Amélie. Even his
excursion to Hollywood did not affect his artistic integrity. Alien Resurrection has Jeunet’s touch all over it. But in
a time dominated by fast food instant cultural consumption and a visual style that is reduced to a nervy, nauseating shaky
shoulder camera, can you still take your time to make your spectators dream? In this surrealist country, our answer is a loud
and resounding YES! Come and witness how maestro Jeunet will let us discover his little trade secrets and go on a journey
behind the scenes of his mythical worlds, with the complicity of Christophe Bourdon (UPCB). And he’ll damn well take all
the time he needs!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and Peter Jackson, who’ll answer all your questions. This workshop explains the stages leading to the production of a 100 %
CGI movie shot. For more than 20 years, Jean-Yves has shown at numerous educational sessions that special effects are an
accessible, effective way to produce movies with artistic expression and has demonstrated how these tools can be used to
give meaning to a picture. Concrete examples from well known movies will illustrate each technique. A shot will be produced
live with a green key and will be shown and discussed at the end of the workshop. This will prove that producing digital
special effects is easy and accessible. This first Synthesis Workshop will also have the honor to welcome an exceptional
guest, Luc Longin, who will talk about his expertise acquired at the sfx studios of Georges Lucas and Peter Jackson. He will
also answer your questions about the jobs and possibilities in digital special effects. And the best of all ? These talents are
all from Belgium !

Pacific Rim’s Kaiju’s, is the figure of Big Brother that came straight from the nightmarish world of George Orwell’s 1984. In his wake, he
took with him a cohort of Little Brothers driven by a dangerous obsession with security, fueled by fear of crisis, terrorists and migrants
... Their high tech weapons are deadly for fundamental freedoms: biometric filing (Gattaca, Elysium) predictable justice (Minority
Report), widespread surveillance of protesters (V for Vendetta, Adjustment Bureau, Brazil, Children of Man, Blade Runner...). “1984 was
a fictional story, not an instruction manual” a cyber activist recently said in a newspaper about privacy threats on the Internet. But
the intrusive shadow of Big Brother largely goes beyond the web, as revealed by Edward Snowden’s highlighting of the clandestine
PRISM mass surveillance program; a script worthy of the best Hollywood paranoia thrillers. Is the power of new technologies going to
transform our lives into the hell imagined by literature and cinema? Haven’t we learned from the warnings given by these dystopian
novels and films? Has Big Brother won the game, 30 years after 1984 ? The French speaking wing of the Human Rights League (LDH)
invites you to debate this with: David Morelli (coordinator of the New Technologies Commission of the LDH), Didier Stiers (journalist
for the French speaking daily Le Soir), Gauthier Keyaerts (cultural journalist and sound artist). Moderator : Jean-Jacques Jespers ( ULB

much more than just a film studio and a production firm. Our
friend, Sir Kaufman, has created an entire universe where bad
taste grows on trees and is cultivated into high art. In 1985, The
Toxic Avenger becomes Troma’s first big success. Lloyd gives
birth to an entire new film genre: comedy slapstick gore. Troma
will have a major influence on a new generation of directors that
were raised on a tromatic diet, such as Quentin Tarantino, Peter
Jackson, Alex de la Iglesia and Takashi Miike. With four decades on
the clock, Troma owes its longevity not only to a man and a team
fully invested in their projects, but also to a big fan community
who are willing to participate to that very special brand of Troma
movie madness.
And to mark the occasion, Uncle Lloyd will be present to blow out
40 candles together with the BIFFF audience. And he’s brought a
surprise with him! But our lips are sealed…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“Made in Hong Kong” is attributed to Zhuangzi Tests His Wife from
1913 ), originating from a tiny appendix to the Chinese mainland,
is worshipped all over the world. Whether it’s about the rivalry
between the Shaw Brothers and Cathay in the sixties, the global
phenomenon that still is Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan’s mind-boggling
slapstick action, Hong Kong Cinema quickly took the bronze medal
on the global movie stage ( after Bollywood and Hollywood ). The
early nineties have seen the emergence of geniuses such as John
Woo, Tsui Hark or also Johnnie To, breaking records at the Asian box
office while giving Hollywood blockbusters a run for its money. Having
survived a drop in production after the Asian crisis of 1997, Hong
Kong cinema is now back in force and the BIFFF intends to celebrate
this in the company of Kenneth Bi, the director of CONTROL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet we have often reduced India to kitschy Bollywood spectacles
or serious art house from the likes of Satyajit Ray or Mira Nair. But
if we take a closer look to what’s been released in recent years on
the Asian subcontinent, we can discover some fantastic pearls like
the first Indian zombie movie or thrillers that give their Western
counterparts a run for their money. And they’re exporting their
know how, as we can see at the BIFFF with Suri Krishnamma and
Richie Mehta respectively helming The Dark Tourist and I’ll Follow
you Down. Europalia might already be over, but that’s no reason
not to celebrate this creative Indian wave in the presence of Amit
