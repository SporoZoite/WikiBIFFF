dreams of becoming a legendary crime figure
by landing in a maximum-security prison for a
failed kidnapping attempt. There he works hard to
establish himself at the top of the prison power
hierarchy through extraordinary erratic behaviour,
alternately violent, affectionate and self-destructive.
Physical brutality, lies, rationalisations and distortions
comprise his modus operandi. Released
from jail eight years later, he is determined to continue
his pursuit for criminal notoriety, whatever
the cost might be to himself or to others.
Chopper is a great first feature for acclaimed music
video director Andrew Dominik. The film explores
the darkest realms of Australia’s underworld
through the eyes of one of his most feared and
infamous criminals. It’s based on the real life of
Mark “Chopper” Read. You never know if what you
see is what actually happened, because the real
Chopper himself, a vivacious raconteur, is always
willing to sacrifice the truth for a good story. The
temporal periods in the film are distinguished not
only by Chopper’s physical changes, but also by
shifts in colour tone from the cold blue stone of the
prison to the saturated reds of the brothels and bars
of the outside world. To top it off, Eric Dana, one of
Australia’s most celebrated stand-up comedians,
plays this notorious character with charismatic
energy backed by complex psychological insight."

to save his true love, Chinese hairdresser Kei.
After he stages a daring helicopter and machine
gun rescue to prevent her deportation, the two
hide out in the back alleys of Shinjuku, Tokyo’s cultural
and criminal melting pot. They plot for freedom
under the protection of the ragtag Brazilian
immigrant community. But they need money for
passports and bribes in order to stow away on a
ship promising freedom. Ambushing a deal
between the Yakuza and Triads garners them a
suitcase of cocaine rather than cash. Now they have
a massive gang war on their hands, bringing bloodshed
into their insulated, family-like neighbourhood,
and their dream of escape turns into a twisted
nightmare.
In The City of Lost Souls, Japanese cult-director
Takashi Miike (Midnight Madness, Fudoh : The New
Generation, The Audition) offers us an ambitious
descent into the underbelly of Tokyo’s criminal
world. Once more, he explores the tension-filled
realm of Japanese Yakuza and Chinese Triads, but
this time he places a mismatched romantic couple
in the midst of his darkly violent vision. Sneering at
the guardians of good taste and political correctness,
Miike orchestrates a symphony of excess with
outrageous and bloody crescendos of S&Mobsessed
gang lords, break dance duels, cockfights,
Ping-Pong showdowns and toilet-bowl beating.
Featuring a cross-cultural cast from all over the
world, The City of Lost Souls is a delirious tale of love
and violence set to a karaoke samba-beat love
song."

meets Sarah during a drunken night at a bar, he
has no idea how the next few hours will affect his
life. Sarah is found murdered in J’s flat, which
plunges him into a world of espionage, deceit, disinformation
and state-ordered executions. J. has
found that he has become the most convenient
suspect. Over the next three days, he races against
the clock to clear his name, absorbing the violence
of several attempts on his life until he is forced to
retaliate.
From the references to the main character as J.,
echoing Kafka’s The Trial, to the multi-narrative
framework seen in such films as The Usual Suspects
and Brazil, The Criminal is an intriguing, dark and
fascinating journey into the world of deceit and
betrayal. The film never ceases to engage the viewer
at every turn, ably assisted by performances from
Steven Mackintosh (Lock, Stock & Two Smoking
Barrels), celebrated comedian Eddie Izzard (Velvet
Goldmine, Shadow of the Vampire) and the late Bob
Peck (Smilla’s Sense of Snow, Fairytale : a True Story).
Writer and director Julian Simpson (Any Dream Will
Do, Thief Takers) makes sure that there’s a lot going
on in The Criminal. This makes the film so enjoyable.
We may be sure in our ability to work out what is

Chasing The Kidney Stone (at the festival in 1998)
and Sophie’s World (presented during our 2000 edition)

Norwegian cinema. After having worked as directors
of trailers and video clips, Johannes Runeborg
and Johan Brännström , director and screenwriter
of Sleepwalker, were given a chance by Jacobsen to
put their terrifying universe on the big screen. They
have succeeded in creating a strong psychological

occurs in the open. People are murdered in broad

reduced to their raw essentials. The screenplay
makes way for a language of images, with meticulous
care applied to photography and lighting. Le
Rat could also be added to this list, relying more on
atmosphere then on a strict logical storyline. The
shooting of Christophe Ali and Nicholas Bonilauri
feature film debut took more than four years, during
which the characters, the situations and the
script were refined and rewritten on a day by day
basis. With its industrial soundtrack and black and
white imagery, the movie brings David Lynch’s
Eraserhead in mind, but its directors have also
wanted to render homage to films like Theodore
Dreyer’s Vampyr or Charles Laughton’s Night of the
Hunter. Some very worthy references indeed."

for the U.S.A. : the civil rights movement in the
South, the Vietnam War, race riots, student revolts,…
This led to the rise of young independent mavericks
who broke the conventions of the traditional horror
genre. Their films were a reflection on the society
they were living in. The documentary The American
Nightmare features interviews with masters of the
horror genre, such as George Romero, John
Carpenter, Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven and David
Cronenberg, groundbreaking filmmakers who incorporated
social commentary into sordid tales of terror.
In their movies, the monsters became our neighbours,
family members, the police and the government.
With Cronenberg’s Shivers and Carpenter’s
Halloween, the freedom of the sexual revolution
came to an end as desire resulted in venereal madness
and carnage. Wes Craven aptly describes their
interpretations as a “boot camp for the psyche”, preparing
us for the horrors of daily urban life.
Utilizing film clips from noted academics, horror film
director and screenwriter Adam Simon (Brain Dead,
Carnosaur, Bones) draws from these directors new
insights on their work. Especially intriguing is makeup
effects wizard Tom Savini’s confession that inspiration
for his realistic gore effects comes from the
bloodshed and danger experienced first-hand during
his service in Vietnam. This documentary sheds
light on why we cover our eyes, dread the ensuing
nightmares, but always return to the cinema for

Aoyama of an abandoned feature-film project and
suggests mounting auditions for the female lead,
which will allow him to pick a potential bride. Only
one candidate stands out, Asami, a 24-year old former

people who disappeared from her life.
The Audition is a truly shocking horror film about
obsession gone evil. It’s made even more disturbing
by its haunting beauty and its deliberate style. The
central theme of the movie is the effect on women
of Japanese male sexual attitudes, assumptions and
actions. This latest outrage from Takashi Miike,
director of the elegant Bird People of China, the
blood-splattered Fudoh : The New Generation (presented

employs the latest CGI technologies to increase the
wonder and beauty of its awe-inducing images,
supported by mesmerizing performances from fine
actors : Tadanobu Asano (Taboo, Away With Words)
as the Prince, Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha, Ran) as
Benkei and Masatoshi Nagase (Mystery Train, Cold
Fever) as the vagabond."

Julien Donkey-Boy, the first American Dogma 95

which says “purification salt”, the kind used in religious

Takagi starts to recover more and more pieces of his
lost weekend. As his past actions, from the brainless
to the deadly, begin to impinge on his increasingly
desperate present, the story moves towards an
explosive and absurd finale.
The ways of Japanese corporate society and its
underworld shadow may still be mysterious to the
West, but idiocy is universal. This is proven in Monday,
the latest film of Sabu, director of such highly
entertaining

Blues and Dangan Runner. The inept and bungling
yakuza in Sabu’s films have won him acclaim and
recognition as a subversive director. Unlike Takeshi
Kitano, also known for his yakuza films, Sabu provides
his films with a touch of comic relief. They often
end on a note of anticipation with nothing resolved.
He offers no ready solutions to the issues he raises,
issues which confront contemporary Japan and the
Japanese. Shinichi Tsutsumi as Takagi is a major reason

accompanied by eccentric characters played by

film, structured like a long fever dream. It’s broken
up into fragmented episodes that deal with common
themes : religion, creativity, familial politics, perversion
and the raw, horrific honesty of the human being.
Vignettes that sometimes veer from narrative segments
to expressionistic bridges make up this assault
on the senses and sensibilities of the audience.
Shocking and occasionally nightmarish, it dives head
first into the dark aspects of our person; all while keeping
a focused, obsessive stance. If you destroy the left,
logical half of the brain, you’ll drown in dreams.
Canadian director Karim Hussain filmed various
super 8 shorts as a child, easing into cinema professionally
as a screenwriter, director of photography
and second-unit director. He has produced two
shorts, Eyes To Hell (1991) and Subconscious Prelude
(1993), which, as its title suggests, is a forerunner of
his first feature film, Subconscious Cruelty. With this
debut, Karim Hussain has offered us one of the most
complex and daring films in recent times. Influenced
by the work of directors such as David Lynch,
Alejandro Jodorowsky, Luis Bunuel and Dusan
Makejev, this unclassifiable movie took more than
six years to make. It had to survive hostage-taking of
the original negative, crew rebellions, ice-storms,
drug problems, theft, health problems, arrests on
obscenity charges, deaths etc… The result:
Subconscious Cruelty is a poetic, philosophical and
ruthlessly extreme film that attacks and traumatises
the viewer to the limits of their senses."

also an art dealer. After waiting hours for some
food, they decide to find another restaurant. As it is
already late for dinner and with Frank being a vegetarian,
they have a hard time in finding a place.
Their search develops into an odyssey with bus, taxi,
subway and even the ferry, which brings them to
South-America through Notre Dame and Hong
Kong. They finally find a restaurant in the desert,
where they meet another businessman who’s as
lost as they are.
Three Businessmen is a “corporate road movie” by
independent maverick director Alex Cox (Repo
Man, Sid & Nancy, Death & The Compass) and writer-
producer Tod Davies (The Hot Spot, Fear &
Loathing in Las Vegas). In the fifteen years since the
cult-hit Repo Man, the world has become a more
dangerous and ever more alienating place. In Three
Businessmen, we’ll find out if there’s any meaning
behind it all. With Miguel Sandoval (Do The Right
Thing, Get Shorty) as Bennie, Alex Cox as Frank and
music by Debbie Harry and Pray For Rain (Repo
Man, Sid & Nancy)."

Palm",,,,,,,90',"Horror, Science-Fiction, Mystery",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt00243465,",OKANDA. (DET),,,,"Five biologists travel to a remote area to explore
a forest burnt down a few years ago. They’ll
investigate how life returns to this demolished land.
Already on the train problems errupt when one of
them tries to affirm himself as leader of the pack. At
the location they install themselves inside a caravan
and a tent, their homes for the next few weeks. At
the first day of exploration, they find something
strange and hard to identify. This event is the beginning
of a week marked by horror, paranoia and
doubt of their own common sense. Against their
will, the biologists have taken a step into the
unknown. Something is creating fear and anxiety
among the five scientists. Suddenly, the way back
to civilisation seems very long.
You can’t really suspect the Swedes to be overly
chauvinist. But when the Swedish press unanimously
declared The Unknown to surpass The Blair
Witch Project in every way, we’re inclined to take
them on their word. Debut long feature director
Michael Hjorth has delivered a film that efficiently
scares and thrills without having to rely on a frenetically
moving camera."

documentary filmmaker. He has carefully
registered the not very honourable but quite lucrative
activities of his runaway daughter. Now he
returns home with his newfound friend : the man
who assaulted him with a rock. At home his junkie
wife allows herself to be beaten up by her son,
who’s frustrated by the daily humiliations of his
classmates. It doesn’t take long before the visitor
has endeared himself to this dysfunctional family.
Slowly but surely, he exposes their true personalities.
And the more they live out their perversions,
the tighter they become as a family.
That Japanese daredevil Takashi Miike likes to take
risks, we could already witness in The Audition and
City of Lost Souls. But only with Visitor Q do we now
realise how far he’s prepared to go. Miike reduces
his characters to their primal, bestial functions.
Luckily, the trials and tribulations of this apocalyptic
household are accompanied by the necessary
doses of humour, giving you some breathing space
when it all becomes too extreme. Miike’s film, which
often reminds you of Pasolini’s Theorema, is a real
kick in the balls of the politically correct elite and a
challenge for adventurous movie buffs."

The future is now, everything would have changed but it’s not really what it’s supposed to be, this 3rd millennium : no living creature on Mars, with the exception of some wandering Vikings, no space stations waltzing in the cosmic void on music by Strauss, no monolith revealing the meaning of life. Nothing of the predictions became reality. 
We haven’t stopped dreaming though. Artists keep providing us with their visions of a better (or worse) world. And we have worked like crazy to put their creations in an exhilirating programme which is destined to stir your imagination.
Besides, Fantasy is in perfect health. It makes box offices explode all over the world. Renowned authors don’t hide their flirting with the genre anymore. Other artists, like apprentice-sorcerers, enjoy to mix different genres into a magical cocktail. Japan and Korea are  present in full force (1/4th of the selection is devoted to these countries !).
Even better, this year some new disciplines make their entry at the BIFFF through the big gate : the computer game, for which we organise a competition, and the video clip, which will dress the colourful Ball of Vampires in appropriate gothic imagery.  
Once more, there’s a lot to marvel at... or think about. During this 19th Festival, we’ll ask some serious questions and this one in particular : “Does cinema arouse aggression ?”. We’re even friendly enough to try to provide you with an answer during a seminar. 
And let’s not forget about all the other goodies : the Body Painting contest, the Unusual Fashion Show, the exhibitions and animations, the Festival of Fantasy Literature, the Workshop,... and the dozens of guests, from all around the globe, who will attend our festival .  
Will 16 days be enough for all this ?
We’ll soon find out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brussels, Friday 16 March 2001, 23h00 :
like every other second Friday of the Festival, a legion
of fantasy fans storms the stairs of the Auditorium to
participate in a delirious marathon of frights and
shivers, laughter and amazement, surprises and
discoveries. And as always at the end, the valiant
survivors are treated to a hearty, recuperating
breakfast.
But the Festival, being its magnanimous and generous
self, also offers hungry fantasy fans in other cities the
opportunity to a Night with their favourite genre.
They’ll be spoiled with an outstanding selection of
four films from our 2001 programme, accompanied, of
course, by the inevitable breakfast in the early
morning.

2001,event,"Workshop, 6th Workshop ""Brussels Fantastic""",,"6th Workshop ""Brussels Fantastic""",,,,,"Fantasy Brussels
The annual Workshop, organised by the BIFFF, became a tradition. Each year, the students of the Brussels’ film schools, NARAFI and RITS, have the unique opportunity to realise their own short films assisted by a famous international director. During a 12 days period, the students will have the opportunity to learn the shortcuts of filmmaking. At the end, 3 different teams will show us their point of view on the subject “Fantasy Brussels”. 
This year, the students will enjoy the craftsmanship of the American producer and director James B. Harris who will supervise the workshop. Harris is not only known as the producer of The Killing (1956), Paths of Glory (1957) and Lolita (1962), the first films of Stanley Kubrick. He also managed to build up a career for himself as a writer, producer and filmmaker. In 1964, he directed The Bedford Incident, followed by Some Call it Loving (1973) and Fast-Walking (1982), for which he also wrote the screenplays. Harris produced the cold-war thriller Telefon, with Charles Bronson and Donald Pleasence. In 1987 he made Cop, a police-movie based on a book by James Ellroy and in 1993 he wrote and directed Boiling Point, starring Wesley Snipes and Dennis Hopper. 
Continuing last years’ edition, U.I.P. offers the students the possibility to realise their special effects under the wings of the technicians of Studio l’Equipe. 
 
To encourage the students even more UIP created a prize for the most motivated and talented student(s). The winner(s) will be able to attend a workshop at the prestigious short course unit of the NFTS in Great Britain.

2001,event,Gaming,Nexus Awards,The Nexus - Award of the Best Fantasy Computer Game,,,,,"The Fantasy Computer Game
at the BIFFF
We can’t help it : each new discipline needs a
new festival !
In recent years computer games have evolved
at an astounding rate; graphically, aesthetically
and economically. The borders between what’s
real and what’s virtual are crumbling.
One of the most important sources of
inspiration for computer games is the Fantasy
genre, especially cinema and the comic-strip.
The BIFFF just had to do something or die
trying. This first festival wants to give a
complete overview of the computer game in
all its appearances through exhibitions, special
guests, meetings,… but especially through
those that are the cornerstones of the
discipline : the designers !
NEXUS, the Award for Best Fantasy
Computer Game
A festival without awards is like a Belgian waffle
without sugar and cream : not the real thing.
We opted for two awards to be attributed
during this 19th edition of the BIFFF : the
Award for Best Computer Game for console
and the Award for Best Computer Game for PC.
What better judge for gaming qualities than
the players themselves. We asked for the
opinion of specialists in the genre; the editors
of game magazines. Editors of 5 European
game – and computer magazines compose the
two jury’s who will decide which games of the
year 2000 can surf home with the first NEXUS.
Exhibition in the Media Library
The creation of a computer game doesn’t only
mean a bunch of programmers hitting away at
their keyboards. It’s a long process, with
massive amounts of preparatory designs,
storyboards and simulations on the way. The
exhibition in the Media Library of the French
Community gives a good idea about the
creative process behind our interactive
entertainment and shows that designing
computer games gets closer and closer to
making movies.                          The jury’s
PC : Cyrille Baron (Joystick – France), Matthew Pierce (PC Gamer -
Great-Britain), Raf Picavet (Gamespot.be – Belgium), Roland Austinat
(PC Player – Germany), Stefano Silvestri (The Games Machine - Italy)
Consoles : Jean-François Morisse (Joypad - France),

Focus on literature through a meeting with thriller
author, Pieter Aspe. Since 1996, Pieter Aspe works fulltime
as author and screenwriter. His crime fiction, with
assistant officer Pieter Van In and officer of Justice
Hannelore Martens as central figures, invariably takes
place in Bruges. His thrillers were nominated three times
for the Hercule Poirot-award and are at the moment
being adapted for the radio. Some of his most famous

Square of Revenge and Peace Offering.

This classic horror film still possesses a lugubrious
beauty. The script and camera work are terrifyingly
meticulous. Max Schreck plays an unforgettable vampire
evolving in an exuberant set – most of the feature has
been filmed on location in a real castle. Bram Stoker’s
widow sued the film company for plagiarism resulting in
a withdrawal and total destruction of all the prints of this
expressionistic drama. In 1930, the film was released
again in a spoken version as DIE ZWÖLFTE STUNDE-EINE
NACHT DES GRAUENS with music and sound effects. In
1986, Enno Patalas restored a print of 105’.
Thursday, the 15th of March 2001, 10pm, free entrance.
Lecture and film.
On the bloody black list of ‘video nasties’, you’ll find The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre somewhere at the top.
25 years ago, this film unleashed a lot of commotion
from the first day of its release. TCM has been forbidden
in a lot of countries and, in Belgium, it was confiscated
by the police at its first screening. The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre became a cult film and is often used as symbol
for the revival of horror.
Nowadays, the film is seen as a masterpiece, the
chainsaw and the “leatherface” grew into cultural icons.
Rediscover TCM at the KK-VUB, as part of the BIFFF.
During two lectures, Xavier Mendik (head of the Cult
Film Archive at University College Northampton) and
Ernest Mathijs (professor of film at the VUB) will attempt
to explain why TCM owns its special place in film history.
Afterwards, you’ll certainly enjoy the screenings of the
original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and of the illustrious
“The Shocking Truth - the making of TCM”

The Bifff is not only a film festival, it’s also keen on
giving its spectators some food for thought. We’re
fascinated by all kind of themes that have a
connection with cinema and with the fantasy genre
in particular. We like to devote our time to these
matters, so that we can share our knowledge with
our spectators.
And this year we’re going to get serious !
During our previous edition, dozens of festival fans
were questioned about their attitudes towards
fiction films and the influence of violence in the
audiovisual media on their lives. The results of this
survey form the base of a colloquium that will be
held on Wednesday 14 March.
The seminar will be introduced by the
announcement of the survey’s results. This is
followed by debates and analyses from experts of
the concerned sectors. Organised in panels, film
professionals, social workers, representatives of the
public authorities and psychologists will explain
and defend their points of view. After each debate,
the audience can participate in the discussion.
The Bifff hopes to create some clarity in this much
discussed but hardly researched subject. As
organisers of an important film festival, we want to
take up our responsibility and contribute to this
