coastal town where Clary starts selling tricks at the
local fancy fair. One of her clients is the shy and lonely
Noel, who own a rundown hotel called Byzantium.
Clare convinces Noel to let them move in with him and
pretty soon Byzantium becomes her base of operations.
Eleanor is rediscovering the town, thinking about
the last time they were here… some 200 years ago.
Because this is where she was born and where she
and her mother were turned into vampires. She longs
to find someone to unburden herself and that person
is the sickly teenager Frank. But her confession sets a
series of events in motion that alerts the Brotherhood
of Vampires. Clare and Eleanor are outcasts and have
been on the run from them for practically their entire
existence. Darvel, the leader of the Brotherhood, has
sworn to destroy them and heads for Byzantium.
Seventeen years after Interview With The Vampire, Neil
Jordan gives us a luscious, highly atmospheric and exciting
contemporary vampire drama. The camerawork
of DOP Sean Bobbit ( Shame, Hunger, Oldboy ) is a joy
to watch, from blood drenched waterfalls and strange
crypts to windswept coasts. Saoire Ronan ( Atonement,
The Host ) and Gemma Arterton ( Quantum of Solace,
Clash of the Titans ) draw all attention to themselves as
the drop dead gorgeous mother and daughter vampire
pair. Sam Riley ( Control, On The Road ) incarnates their
nemesis Darvell."

disappearance – that of Nicholas Barclay,
a 13 year-old Texas boy who vanishes without a trace.
Three and a half years later, staggering news arrives:
the boy has been found, thousands of miles from home
in Spain, saying he survived a mind-boggling ordeal
of kidnap and torture by shadowy captors. His family
is ecstatic to have him back no matter how strange
the circumstances. But things become far stranger
once he returns to Texas. Though the family accepts
him, suspicion surrounds the person who claims to be
Nicholas. How could the Barclay’s blonde, blue-eyed
son have returned with darker skin and eyes ? How
could his personality and even accent have changed so
profoundly ? Why does the family not seem to notice the
glaring differences ? And if this person who has arrived
in Texas isn’t the Barclay’s missing child... who on earth
is he ? And what really happened to Nicholas ?
From Sundance to BAFTA, Bart Layton’s first feature
delighted critics all over the world and has already won
ten awards. This documentary, conceived like a thriller,
draws us into a gripping mystery, The Imposter is a
masterpiece of the genre, transforming a popular news
item into a tremendous game of deception, with Frédéric
Bourdin as the mean ( and real ) imposter."

best friend Richard in a tragic auto accident on
her 18th birthday, her quiet life on the family’s secluded
estate is suddenly shattered. Exquisitely sensitive, India’s
exhibits an impassive demeanor which masks the deep
feelings and heightened senses that only her father understood.
India finds herself drawn to her father’s long-lost
brother, Charlie, who unexpectedly arrives for the funeral
and decides to stay on with her and her emotionally unstable
mother, Evie. While India initially mistrusts her charming
but mysterious uncle, he fascinates her as well, and
she begins to realize how much they have in common. As
Charlie reveals himself to her little by little, India becomes
increasingly infatuated with her charismatic relative and
comes to realize that his arrival is no coincidence. With her
uncle to guide her, she is about to fulfill her unusual destiny.
Filmmaker Park Chan-Wook ( Old Boy, Lady Vengeance,
Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance ) has created a singular body
of work during his more than 20 years as a writer, director
and producer of some of Korean cinema’s most innovative
and original movies, crafting feverish scenarios that combine
lyrical beauty with shattering acts of violence and operatic
emotion. Stoker is a dark and disturbing thriller about a mysterious
and isolated American family. Even the film’s title
makes metaphorical allusion to evil, invoking the name of
Dracula author Bram Stoker, whose groundbreaking novel is
as much about an opportunist who preys on the innocent as
it is the supernatural world of the vampire. Stoker features
a terrific cast led by Nicole Kidman ( Eyes Wide Shut, The
Others ) as Evie, Mia Wasikowska ( Alice In Wonderland ) as
India and Matthew Goode ( Watchmen ) as Charlie."

struggling to make ends meet. When a magical
artefact from the past suddenly provides an answer
to their troubles, they must face the question of how
far they want to go to strike it rich and if the cost of
wealth is worth it. The magic teapot has the power to
bestow riches upon Alice and John, but only in exchange
for physical pain and injury. We see the couple’s relationship
change and strain under the pressure of their
discovery. At the same time, we trace the origins of this
mysterious, destructive object, that has left a centuries
long trail of misery in its wake.
Ramaa Mosley’s The Brass Teapot is in essence a contemporary
grim fairy tale, but with a dark twist. Adapted
from a short story by Tim Macy, that already inspired
Mosley’s short feature from 2007, The Brass Teapot
presents a singular critic of prevailing consumerism.
Headlining this cautionary tale are rising stars Juno
Temple ( Kaboom, The Dark Knight Rises, Killer Joe )

who the perpetrator might be, nor any idea of the fate

His conversations through the walls lead him to

Chiba begins to recall what he truly used to be, and
realizes what is really important in life. But when his
daughter’s container finally stops beside his, with no
means of escape, has his repentance come too late ?
After Battlefied Baseball, Yakuza Weapon and Deadball
( screened at the BIFFF 2012 ), Yudai Yamaguchi takes
an unexpected U-turn in his career with Abductee. His
latest flick is a super-psycho-claustro thriller that reveals
a much darker side of the director and recalls
classic gems such as Cube ( Silver Raven of the BIFFF
in 1999 ), Buried and Symbol ( 7th Orbit winner of the

before Ana gives him the brush off, their bus is involved
in a devastating crash. When Ana wakes up in her bed,

When she crosses paths once again with Freddy, they

their small town… And this mysterious wall of dark
fog encircling the place won’t help them feeling better.
Especially when they meet a ravenous creature hiding
in the moving cloud and determined to rip off some
flesh and blood…
After, the first long feature film written and directed by
Ryan Smith, has undoubtedly some Lovecraftian horror
roots mixed with Stephen King’s early writings. A parallel
universe, monstrous creatures... this depopulated
Twilight Zone meets Silent Hill, unfolds its mystery with
a crispy twist ! Not to mention the outstanding performances
of Karolina Wydra ( Dr House’s mysterious
wife ! ) and Steven Strait who started his career with

no matter how intelligent, talented and ambitious she is,
at the moment she doesn’t have one cent to continue
her education. She even auditions with a strip club to
earn a little extra. But the owner makes her a surprising
offer : stitching up someone who was beaten into
a bloody pulp in the basement. It’s very unpleasant
work, but it pays well and it draws the attention of
stripper Beatress. She had her body changed to look
like Betty Boop. Impressed by Mary’s work, she offers
her money for some drastic plastic surgery. And that’s
how Mary gets drawn into the “body mod” community.
The members consider their body to be an empty
canvas that can be cut into and altered as they please.
It doesn’t take long before stress, personal problems
and the increasingly extreme demands of her “patients”
drive Mary over the edge.
Horror doesn’t have to be an exclusively male domain.
The identical twins Jen and Sylvia Soska inject a well
needed dose of estrogen into the genre. Their controversial
debut feature, Dead Hooker In A Trunk, gained
lots of festival attention, but with American Mary they
make a huge leap forward. It’s not only a compelling and
disturbing exploration of a little known subculture, but
also a mind boggling American Psycho-like social satire.
Katherine Isabelle, the heroine from the Ginger Snaps
trilogy, delivers a stand-out performance as Mary Mason."

their way back home after their father Nick
died during a camping trip. Their Jeep has sunk in the
mud and there’s no cell phone connection. They decide
to walk towards the direction from which they came.
What seems to be a journey home for two teenagers,
slowly turns into a surreal and singular tale. The forest
breathes into a life of its own, as a mysterious manifestation
spies on the kids. Chris suddenly appears to be
on a different kind of quest. He seems to know what is
going on and all he wants is to reach Nick. He has the
urge to reveal deep family secrets that have troubled his
father for a long time. We slowly slip into a parallel world
where nothing is what it seems. A place inhabited by
curious characters and nightmarish creatures. A place
where Fear and Anger of a teenager’s angst turn into
real demons. A place where, for a brief moment, all
questions can be answered.
Giorgio Serafini’s movie gives us a message of hope
about human resilience. The Between, just like his previous
movie Johnny’s Gone, is inspired by the tragic
loss of his daughter. Serafini presents a dreamlike and
magnificently photographed audio-visual odyssey,
which benefits from a terrific cast, including James
Legros ( Zodiac, Point Break ), Joel Courtney ( the lead
from J.J. Abrams’ Super 8 ), Isabelle Fuhrman ( the lead
from Esther, our 2010 Golden Raven ) and Peter Bogdanovich

and Tim will begin a terrifying descent into a world of
depravity and chilling violence as he is held chained and
captive by a psychopathic serial killer named Bob. The
man changes Tim’s name into Rabbit. Nine years pass.
Rabbit, now a teenager, moves through the house on
a tethered chain and goes about his grisly tasks with
practiced proficiency. As a morbid surrogate father, Bob
starts teaching Rabbit the tools of his trade. He forces
him to dissect the bodies of the victims, showing him
sadistically which stab wounds bleed the most, which
are the most painful. But there is still something of
Tim left inside Rabbit, something alive fighting back
against the soul-crushing evil for the right to live his
life on his terms…
Jennifer Lynch’s first feature, Boxing Helena, about a
grotesque, obsessive and mutilating love, caused so
much controversy that we had to wait fifteen years
before the daughter of the grandmaster of surreal
nightmares realised her second film; the ingenious
mystery thriller Surveillance ( 2008 ). Chained, her
latest achievement, will leave no one indifferent. This
exploration of the psyche of a serial killer, a standout
performance by Vincent d’Onofrio ( Full Metal Jacket,
Men in Black ), feels so chillingly real that the US censors
gave it a +17 rating, which is – strange but true
– higher than the one for the immensely popular torture

Yeah, right… Rumors even say that the incidents have

To ensure that they are damnation-ready twenty-four

wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and gluttony. The
Brooklyn Parish of Hellbenders has six members, lead

a big city street. Suddenly a blinding light appears
that transports them to a very peculiar racing
course. A voice sounds in everybody’s head : “The
school, the house and the prison are safe. Follow the
arrows or you will die. Stay on the path or you will
die. If you’re doubled twice, you will die. Do not touch
the grass or you will die. Race or die.” Whether you’re
rich or poor, old or young, blind, strong, handicapped,
courageous or a coward; the rules make no distinction.
There can be only one winner !
The best genre movies can often be summarized in
one phrase and The Human Race, the long feature debut
of Paul Hough, definitely belongs to this category :
“Race or die !”. And this brilliantly simple concept is
translated into one of strongest and most original films
of the year. The Human Race fascinates from start to
finish, is never predictable, lives up to its concept and
is over before you know it. This is survival horror at
its very best, with strong, credible characters that you
also don’t very often see in this kind of films : two deaf
best friends, a highly pregnant woman, a WO II veteran
in a wheelchair, two young kids and a one-legged Iraq
veteran. The latter is a part by Eddie McGee, who really
does miss a leg and gives a superb performance that
will blow your mind. Battle Royale has finally found a
worthy successor."

and two kids when they are surprised by the
arrival of an uninvited guest. Before he knows what’s
going on, he experiences a time lapse and finds himself
separated from his family. The man wakes up in the
forest, half buried in an improvised grave. He doesn’t remember
anything, until he finds a mysterious recording
in an abandoned shack. This is the beginning of a dark,
frightening game between him and the weird guest. His
family is being tortured and he quickly has to win this
game if he wants to have a chance to save them! Soon,
blood is flowing and dead bodies are showing up. He
finds out that there’s another family in the forest who
might be related to what’s going on.
Indonesian director Joko Anwar came to the BIFFF in
2008 with the fantastic and intriguing mystery Kala.
He’s back with a new gem, a “slow burner” as they
say, which crawls into you like a virus and will makes
your hair stand on end. You’ll never want to walk alone
in the forest again."

twins with two heads sharing one body.
Dong-hyun has the full control of their shared body, except
his brother’s head which is attached to the back of his.
The two can never look at each other directly, as their
heads always face the opposite direction. Dong-hyun looks
“normal” as long as he wears his hoodie, which fully covers
his brother’s face. The two have lived nearly 30 years in
a remote house with their father, who tells them not to go
outside the property. However, things change when their
father brings Seung-ah, a bubbly, good-hearted young artist,
to the house to help Dong-hyun publish a children’s
book, one of his lifelong dreams. Despite having the same
body, the brothers share little else. While Sang-hyun is
patient and generous, Dong-hyun is always questioning
something and extremely selfish. Dong-hyun gradually
builds a grudge against Sang-hyun, blaming him for his
unhappiness and isolated life. Sang-hyun, who lets his
brother do whatever he wants, does not recognize his own
wants and needs until he gets to know Seung-ah. And
things worsen as Dong-hyun, who wants to appear as a
“normal writer” for his upcoming book, desperately tries
hiding what he thinks as his ultimate flaw, his own brother.
The Peach Tree is actress-director Hye-seon Koo’s second
feature after her debut Magic from 2010. It’s a compelling
and touching look into the lives of Siamese twin brothers.
Besides great performances from Seung-woo Jo ( Tazza :
The High Rollers ) and Deok-hwan Ryoo (Welcome To Dongmakgol)
as the twins, the film also benefits from a gripping
narrative structure and a powerful dramatic flow. Sang-mi
Nam ( Possessed ) gives a standout performance as well."

He’s
a typical macho. During the day he works his
ass off and at night he gets drunk to blow off steam. As
a child Remington mercilessly harassed his homosexual
neighbor until the man put a curse on him. One day
Remington would turn gay. And it seems like the curse
is slowly but surely working its magic. Remington is
being forced out of a closet he never thought he’d be in.
First his body language turns pink, then the way he talks
and finally his sexual preference. Poor Remington finds
himself entangled in a confusing threesome with his
best friend and girlfriend. In the meantime his mother,
a police officer, tries to find the perpetrator of a series
of murders in the city’s gay and transsexual community.
And the victims do not intend to remain under ground.
They’re coming out of their coffins, Gloria Gaynor style !
A gay zombie comedy from the Philippines !? That description
should already be enough to lure you to the
BIFFF. Remington & The Curse of the Zombadings has
more than enough paranoid hetero’s, cops on roller
skates, vengeful drag queens, homophobic serial killers
and pink zombies to satisfy even the most demanding
lovers of extreme oddities. But this weird comedy is also
a very smart movie that never stoops to stereotypes or
clichés. Director Jade Castro makes fun of homophobia
and machismo and turn Remington not only into a
hilarious viewing experience, but also into a swinging
statement against intolerance and small-mindedness."

With his second feature film, Jason Ford has undoubtedly
crafted a disturbing and penetrative slice of social

The feature film debut from Spanish director Jorge Torrefrossa

You can describe it as a psychological nightmare about

Spanish director Oscar Aibar is known for his feature
debut Atolladero ( 1995 ), a deliciously crazy postapocalyptical
western starring Iggy Pop as a merciless
bounty hunter. In The Forest he mixes historical drama
with horror and science fiction. Most movies about the
Spanish civil war take the side of the Republic and demonize
Franco’s fascists, but in The Forest it is war
itself that corrupts everyone and blurs the lines between
good and bad. This original genre picture benefits
from the convincing performances of Alex Brendemuhl
( Painless ) as Ramon and Maria Molins as Dora. Tom
Sizemore ( Heat, Black Hawk Down ) plays Pickett."

apartment complex with her parents and her
younger brother. On the first night in her new room,
she is awoken by a strange scratching sound coming
from the apartment of her neighbor, a reclusive old
man who has refused all attempts at communication.
Concerned over his well being, Asuka enters his home
only to find him dead from malnutrition. Worse, it looks
as if he had been trying to claw his way into her room.
From Shinobu, the handyman who cleans up the old
man’s apartment, Asuka learns that there have been
a number of strange deaths in the complex over the
years. Even the girls at school whisper rumors of it being
haunted. When the late night scratching returns, Asuka
ventures back into her neighbor’s home and comes face
to face with an apparition of the old man! Panicked by
the discovery of her apartment emptied and her family
gone, Asuka seeks help from Shinobu, who brings in a
spiritualist to exorcise Asuka of the evil surrounding her.
Hideo Nakata, the godfather of J-Horror, goes back to
his roots with The Complex! While reminiscent of Dark

It’s almost unbelievable, but it’s already twenty years
ago that Steven Spielberg started the digital effects
revolution. In stead of time consuming stop motion
techniques, computers were now capable of creating
lifelike moving animals. The dino’s and especially the
T-Rex and those pesky Velociraptors looked so real that
they made many a spectator jump out of their seats.
Jurassic Park became the biggest box office hit of all

T-Rex jump out of the screen in this remastered 3-D

Ihatove with his parents and his little sister
Neri. But when an endless winter arrives, Budori gets
separated from his family. He’s forced to leave on a
journey of self-discovery. His quest leads him to the big
city. He finds work, grows up and makes friends. Then
a new cold front approaches, a winter of snow and ice
that threatens to destroy his new home. Budori will not
allow this to happen again. Together with his friends he
will try to save the world.
The Life of Budori Gusuko is a book by Kenji Miyazawa,
considered in Japan to be the greatest child novelist of
the 20th century. Director Sugii Gisaburo learned the
tricks of the trade at the Toei Studios, where he befriended
the legendary mangaka Osamu Tezuka ( Astro
Boy ). His animation feature debut was in 1974 with Jack
and the Beanstalk. He achieved worldwide popular and
critical success with animation gems such as Night on
the Galactic Railroad ( 1985 ) and Tale of Genji ( 1987 ).
Gisabura adapted Miyazawa’s book into an enchanting
piece of animation, with heart rendering visuals and a
timeless ecological message."

William Lustig’s Maniac from 1980 has become a true

psychological depth and giving the violence an almost

Kaiser Germany and Czarist Russia. Much like our
own 1914, this alternate steampunk Earth is also at the
brink of its first world war. The newly-formed League
of Nations has created an international rapid reaction
force, A.R.E.S., to be the first line of defence against
the return of the Martians. And they should be ready,
because this is the time the Martians have chosen to
invade again !
This American-Asian steampunk extravaganza, an
imaginative sequel to HG Wells’ classic, took five years
to complete. War of the Worlds : ( in glorious 3D ) was
directed by Joe Pearson, animation supervisor for the
anime Highlander : The Search for Vengeance, and is
stuffed with thrills for diehard fans of Steamboy and
Akira : retro-futuristic scenery, heroic battles, superb
production design and non-stop action that will not give
you one moment to relax."

and is too scared to take any steps to
fix his miserable life. After losing another worthless job,
he joins his good friend Valera for a beach party, where
they meet Natalia… the love of Ivan’s life. Unfortunately,
a meteor hits the Earth on the very same night and
starts spreading a very familiar infection. Soon the party
turns into a bloodbath where everyone is in serious
danger of being torn apart by hordes of zombies. Those
who are bitten get infected and gradually turn into mad
creatures trying to attack anyone who feels fear, in other
words, everyone ! These zombies can smell human fear
from miles away, which makes their numbers increase
exponentially and rapidly reducers the numbers of live
humans. Gradually Ivan and his friends understand that
the only way to survive is to get rid of their fear. Vodka
and heavy drugs seem to be their only chance !
Kirill Kemnits’ Zombie Fever ( almost based on a true
story ) is a roaring tribute of a genre fan for genre fans.
If you love politically incorrect madness, then this outrageous
comedy, steeped in a barrel of horrors, is the
one not to miss. Think of Zombies of Mass Destruction
( BIFFF 2010 ), mixed with Shaun of the Dead and add
the sexy Julia Volkova ( ex-singer from the band t.ATu )
as the icing on the cake. Welcooome !!!"

the children that were once taken from her.
Now she’s bound to a remote cabin in the woods. When
a depressive father arrives on the spot to take his own
life, intending to take his two little daughters with him,
Mama ferociously intervenes. Five years later, the authorities
discover two feral children in the cabin. They
move on all fours and are barely able to speak. Eight
year old Victoria and six year old Lilly are physically
healthy, but emotionally scarred. Psychologists think
that they compensated for their isolation by inventing
a fictional female protector. The girls move in with their
uncle Lucas, a rock musician, and his girlfriend Annabel.
It doesn’t take long before spooky things start
to happen in Lucas’ mansion. Mama has followed her
protégées and she has no intention to deliver them to
their new surrogate parents without a fight.
In 2008 Andres and Barbara Muschietti, brother and
sister, realized a very frightening short about a ghost
with overdeveloped maternal instincts. This longer version
is as intense as the original and became a surprise
box office hit in the States. The influence of executive
producer Guillermo Del Toro doesn’t hurt, of course.
Mama is stuffed with impressive and elegant visuals
and introduces you to one of the most gruesome phantoms
ever. Mama also benefits from the sex-appeal of
Danish hunk Nikolaj Coster-Waldau ( Jamie Lannester
from Game of Thrones ) as Lucas and scream queen
Jessica Chastain ( Texas Killing Fields, Lawless, Zero
Dark Thirty ) as Annabel."

At the end of April 2012, with Jim Morrisson
singing The End through our earphones, we
threw one last moist-eyed glance at Tour &
Taxis.
All those unforgettable moments we’ve
had there ! A place like that was the
ideal playground for a bunch of inspired
troublemakers like us !
Then why are we moving ?
First and for all, for practical reasons.
The seats, which we retrieved from about
everywhere – Brussels, Paris and beyond –
and that we moved each year from cave to
attic and from attic to cave, started to loose
their shape. Those seats were threatening to
let us down !
Their end was written in the stars.
What could we have done without them
at Tour & Taxis ?
That’s why the 31st edition of the BIFFF
will take place at the Center for Fine Arts
( CFA ) : three theatres with everything already
installed ( big sigh of relief ! ).
But it’s a place that needs a thorough makeover
to create that famous atmosphere that
makes the BIFFF so special.
The Center for Fine Arts is a respectable old
lady of almost one hundred years, where
the young and feisty BIFFF, with its thirty
summers, will have to adapt itself. It’s a
place with which the BIFFF will have to fuse.
This classified, even sacred monument, has
to be approached with tact before it’ll be
transformed by the weird and wacky event
that we are.
It’s especially a place that has to be adopted
by our audience.
We’re already getting flooded with anguished
messages : will we be able to find our beloved
BIFFF in the maze of the CFA ?
Will you still feel at home there ?
We’re keeping our fingers crossed… because
with the program that we’re presenting you,
you will not be able to stand still for one
second !!!
13 world and international premières,
16 European premières, 66 Belgian
premières… Run to your pharmacist and buy
that extra dose of vitamins !

even if a spontaneous mutation would occur
during adolescence, you still need to
pass one crucial stage before becoming
a professional director: learning how to
make movies! That’s why, for 17 years
now, the BIFFF organizes the Workshop
“Fantastic Brussels”. The students of
two Brussels’ film schools, the RITS and
the INSAS, write, prep, shoot and edit two
fantastic shorts under the supervision of
an experienced foreign filmmaker.
The 18th edition of Fantastic Brussels will
be supervised by British director, producer
and screenwriter Julian Richards. The
BIFFF and Julian go way back, as he came
to Brussels in 1997 to present his first
long feature DARKLANDS; a debut that
later that year went on to win the Silver
Méliès at Fantasporto. Since then, we
were able to enjoy genre gems such as
THE LAST HORROR MOVIE and, more recent,
SHIVER. It’s going to be a hell of a
workshop 2013 !
The two scripts that were selected this
year are :
Rotten People by Elke Vanoost
The Locksmith by Jesse Vander Meersch
D-Day will be Friday 12 April, the day of
the official screening of the two short
features during the Belgian Film Day
at the BIFFF, accompanied by applause
and acclaim from the audience and in the
presence of Julian Richards.
Besides the satisfaction of a job well
done, one lucky student will receive the
Eye-Lite Award, consisting of 2500 Euro
worth of lighting equipment for the winner’s
next project.
This workshop wouldn’t be possible without
the support of the Flemish Community
Commission of the Brussels Capital
Region and our partners : Jean-Pierre
Finotto’s Make-Up School, Eye-Lite,
ES Broadcast & Media, TV Connections,
CGI Trainer and production studio

2013,event,Cosplay,,7th Cosplay Contest,,,,,"If by chance, while wandering through the corridors of the
Center For Fine Arts, your eyes would stray on an Akira drinking
a Troll beer or even a Princess Peach adjusting her corset
– in other words life size video game, manga or anime characters
– you don’t have to worry you’re hallucinating. You’ve
just spotted a Cosplayer.
This community event, originating from Japan, consists
in the reproduction ( with powerful details and fluorescent
panties ! ) of the outfit of a fictional character from a computer
game, a manga or an anime movie or tv-series. But don’t
think this is just a cheap costume that’s held together by a
few stitches and needles. Cosplayers invest lots of time and
money to create the perfect costume with the right makeup,
special hairdo and the accessories that are typical to the
character. All very “kawai” ( cute ), as they say in Japanese !
Japan is, of course, Cosplay Central, with a great number
of competitions and fanatical devotees, who confront each
other at numerous conventions and festivals such as Japan
Expo. By the way, the very first cosplayer was an American
and not just anybody. Forrest J. Ackerman ( who visited the
BIFFF in 1984 ), author, producer and legendary screenwriter
( he was the creator of Vampirella ), is considered to be the
originator of the craze. He attended the first American science
fiction convention ( WorldCon ) disguised as “future
man”… in 1993.
Nowadays, the costume playing cult has also reached
the old continent : France, Italy… and Belgium, where the
7th Cosplay Contest will take place at the BIFFF. It’s a unique
occasion to admire the heroes of virtual popular culture in
three dimensions.
This is the 4th time that the Belgian selection for EuroCosplay
will be held at our beloved festival. The winner will represent
our country at the big finale in London at the MCM Expo in
October. This European competition gathers no less than 23
countries. Our cosplayers will have to give their all to become
the Belgian candidate for London !
