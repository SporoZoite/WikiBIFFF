Blood Moon,blood-moon,25140,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Let’s go back to Colorado in 1887. The sky is dominated by a blood red moon. In a typical small town, a number of mysterious characters cross paths, among whom Calhoun (Shaun Dooley), a lone gunslinger. They are captured by a band of outlaws, but after a while they discover a bigger threat that might kill them all: a mythical beasts that only comes out when that pretty moon is red. It’s going to be a long night, with any hope of seeing daylight fading fast.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fans of the TV series Misfits are warned. Shaun Dooley is even more frightening on the big screen than as a probation worker. This horror-western was directed by none other than Jeremy Wooding, known for Magnificent Eleven and the hit series Peep show. He situates the story at the end of the Wild West and infuses it with supernatural powers. Just to be clear; this is not Cowboys &amp; Aliens, but a balanced mix between the best genre elements: The Good, the Bad and the Terrifying!</p>",draft,2015-02-23 13:05:42,4739,,hidden,,https://archives.bifff.net/?post_type=product&p=25140,https://archives.bifff.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bloodmoon_poster.jpg,,,simple,exclude-from-catalog|exclude-from-search,2015|movie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CNA,2|1|0,,English,3|1|0,,Anna Skellern|Corey Johnson|Rafaella Degruttola|Shaun Doolly,6|1|0,,,,,Méliès Competition,12|1|0,,UK,1|1|0,,Jeremy Wooding,5|1|0,,Jinga Films,10|1|0,,horror,0|1|0,,,,,Jeremy Wooding|Michael Vine,9|1|0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alan Wightman,7|1|0,,Toby Pitman,8|1|0,,Dutch|French,4|1|0,,2014,11|1|0,
Charlie's Farm,charlies-farm,25155,,"Bored with not much to do, Jason, Donkey, Natasha and Melanie head out to Charlie’s farm for the weekend. They want to explore the urban legend of a psycho killer, Charlie, whose parents were murdered by a vengeful mob accusing the couple of terrible doings towards backpackers working the farm. It’s not long into the group’s trip when we’re introduced to Charlie. And he’s hell bent on continuing the family tradition and killing the intruders in the most violent ways imaginable.
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This slasher from down under is a riotous piece of hack and slash fun that would make good ol’ Wes Craven proud. The plot might have been used countless times (thou shalt not wander into the woods to explore remote cabins with murderous maniacs running around), Charlie’s Farm is made with so much guts and energy and contains plenty of hilarious dialogues and volcanic blood eruptions, that you can only observe the carnage with a satisfied grin on your face.</p>",draft,2015-02-23 14:24:53,4739,,hidden,,https://archives.bifff.net/?post_type=product&p=25155,https://archives.bifff.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/charliesfarm_officialposter.jpeg,,,simple,exclude-from-catalog|exclude-from-search,2015|movie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CNA,3|1|0,,English,4|1|0,,Bill Moseley|Kane Hodder|Nathan Jones|Tara Reid,7|1|0,,,,,,,,Australia,2|1|0,,Chris Sun,6|1|0,,Shoreline Ent.,10|1|0,,gore|serial killer|slasher,0|1|0,,European Premiere,1|1|0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Chris Sun,8|1|0,,Mark Smyth,9|1|0,,Dutch|French,5|1|0,,2014,11|1|0,
Danny's Doomsday,dannys-doomsday,25169,,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A disaster of apocalyptical proportions strikes during a relentless heatwave. Danny and his younger brother William have not always been able to get along. They live in a quiet little town where nothing ever happens until the day that climate change leads to the impossible. Deadly monsters crawl out of the ocean and start killing everyone. Danny and William find shelter in their basement, without knowing the fate of their parents or friends. Tension is tight like a knife and William uses the moment to lash out against Danny for having never stood up for him all these times that he got bullied at school. Will the brothers repair their damaged relation and survive the end of the world?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Host meets An Inconvenient Truth. Scandinavia also seems to have a knack at turning out teen oriented genre flicks. Remember Tomas Alfredson’s brilliant Let The Right One In (Golden Raven BIFFF 2009), partly a coming of age drama, partly a vampire movie. Danny’s Doomsday hails from Denmark and is a solid addition to this ever more popular subgenre.</p>

Divine Move (The),divine-move-the,25182,,"Go champion Tae-seok, is sitting in a van outside a gaming den with an earpiece looking at a monitor. He’s giving instructions to his elder brother, who tries to defeat underground kingpin Sal-soo on the Go board. But the gangsters, who are also cheating, are on to them and Tae-sok has to witness his brother getting killed. Sal-soo pins the murder on him, which gets him sent away behind bars for seven years. Inside prison Tae-seok trains his muscles and brains, preparing for his revenge. Once he’s out, he gathers a team of legendary Go-players and starts to infiltrate Sal-soo’s gang, wanting to take them out one by one.
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Go is an extremely popular strategic game in Asia, with world championships and televised matches drawing crowds of millions. It has an especially huge following in Korea. So it’s no wonder that it proved fertile ground for a hard hitting thriller dealing with gambling, murder, revenge, martial arts and Go itself. Director Beom-gu Cho has turned the game into a life and dead struggle of brawn and brains, starring Woo-sung Jung (The Good, The Bad, The Weird, Reign of Assassins) as Ta-seok.</p>
