of the American countryside. From the outside, it could easily be the location for the 14th remake of
the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And the interior’s a feast for rednecks. But the family will have little
time to do some interior decorating. On their very first night, they’re invaded by a gang of bloodthirsty
barbarians who’ve invited themselves to an improvised housewarming. The assault is extremely
violent, with furniture shattering all over the place and blows and punches coming from everywhere.
Colleen’s maternal instinct transforms her into a tigress and she manages to save her offspring from the
invaders. Sixteen years later, they are still marked by that horrific night. Beth has become a successful
fantasy author, while Colleen still lives in the same house with Vera. And if the latter refuses to leave the
nest, it’s because she suffers from a destructive paranoia which makes her relive those traumatic events
every night. As if nothing has ever ended.
Ten years ago French director Pascal Laugier unleashed Martyrs upon the world,
a modern genre classic whose unrelenting violence still leaves many reeling
today. This year we open the festival with his latest terror feast. Ghostland is a
visual and narrative tour de force, a true rollercoaster of jump scares. And what’s
remarkable is that he managed to convince famous French singer Mylène Farmer
to play a part that totally goes against her image. She’ll release her deepest
demons in this nerve-shattering horror pic."

involves moving her children back to her family home in America. Twenty-one-year-old Jack,
19-year-old Jane, 18-year-old Billy and five-year-old Sam try to keep going after Rose passes
away, maintaining a low profile in their large, rural estate, with only a close friendship with the
neighboring girl, Allie to keep them sane. And their sanity will be tested to the limits, as a monstrous
presence start to make itself felt.
Marrowbone might be Sergio C. Sánchez feature debut, but he’s far from being a
novice in the film industry. He’s none other than the genius screenwriter of The
Orphanage, The End and The Impossible. He presents us with a gothic horror
tale worthy of Edgar Allan Poe, while infusing solid layers of mystery to create an
unbearable atmosphere of tension. It’s no wonder that J.A. Bayona was eager to
produce the film of his favorite scriptwriter, before tackling the dinosaurs of Jurassic
World: The Fallen Kingdom!"

more complicated than they had expected. The odd couple can only rely on each other and ends up
having to survive one outrageous situation after another. Will they ever make it across the border
before The Donald puts up his Great Wall of Defense against Illegal Aliens?
For his first big studio project, Australian filmmaker Nash Edgerton succeeded
in getting a dream cast. Or how do you fancy his brother Joel Edgerton (Red
Sparrow), Charlize Theron (Atomic Blonde, Mad Max: Fury Road), David
Oyelowo (Selma, Jack Reacher), Sharlto Copley (District 9, Free Fire), and
Amanda Seyfried (Red Riding Hood)? They shine in this berserk action comedy

ask questions about his mother’s eternal youth.
Mari Okada is one of the most famous screenwriters of Japanese anime: from
SF to horror and live adaptations, she is a true genius who masters all genres,
infusing them with a subtle analysis of human relationships. After the scripts for
The Anthem of the Heart (2015), The Dark Maidens (2017) and My Teacher
(2017), Okada finally debuts as a director with the magical, enchanting and
very moving fantastic tale Maquia: When The Promised Flower Blooms. The

decide to imprison Kei. He becomes a guinea pig of the state. Every day his limbs are cut off,
only to grow back again. Kei gets liberated by Sato, another Ajin, who’s fed up with seeing
his peers chopped up like lizard tails. Sato wants to enroll Kei in his crusade against mankind. Who

wants is a piece of land where he can live in peace, even if this takes millions of dead. Kei will put his
immortality at the service of his enemies, those puny mortals, to stop his mentor.
When X-Men met Highlander, this is how you could summarize this Japanese
blockbuster. Ajin Demi-Human is the long-awaited live adaptation of Gamon
Sakurai’s eponymous manga. With Katsuyuki Motohiro (Bayside Shakedown
trilogy) in the director’s seat, Ajin: Demi-Human smashed the Japanese box office
as soon as it got released. This big budget extravaganza, with amazing SFX by
the team of Ghost in the Shell and Logan, begs to be seen on the biggest possible

to go through the seven circles of hell and as many celestial lawsuits. All of this in order to prove
his worth for each of the sins on the agenda; namely: treason, violence, murder, filial piety, deception,
injustice and indolence. It takes just one sin for eternal hell, which is customized according to the sinner.
And you thought life was hard!
Along With The Gods, based on a popular Korean webcomic, can only be
defined in superlatives. This Taoist reinterpretation of Dante, the third highestgrossing
movie at the Korean box office, is definitely not kidding when it comes
to pulling out all the stops. Kim Yong-hwa’s (Mr Go) new film is a visual
aphrodisiac of action and emotion that puts one money shot after another at a
breathtaking pace. We can’t wait to screen the second part at next year’s BIFFF."

bizarre pattern in which every 25 years on November 11th, people go missing in Mi-hee’s house.
That same night is November 11th and she is convinced strangers are in the house once again …
If this plot outline sounds familiar, you’re damn right because House of the
Disappeared is the South Korean remake of the Venezuelan film The House at
the End of Time (Silver Raven at the 2015 BIFFF). Ever since Horror Stories
(BIFFF 2013), we’ve known that director Dae-wung Lim knows the tricks of
the trade. In the starring role of this macabre haunted house film, we recognize
Yunjin Kim (from the legendary television series Lost), whereas her co-star
Taecyeon is more widely known for being a rapper and a member of the Korean
One Direction."

the two are heading for a showdown...
A nincompoop might be forgiven for thinking this is a remake of Kick-Ass for the
elderly by the Shinya Tsukamoto of Tetsuo. But that’s overlooking BIFFF-regular
Shinsuke Sato. In 2016, the Japanese filmmaker was awarded the Golden Raven
for I Am a Hero and the following year, he presented Death Note: Light Up
the New World. For this adaptation of Hiroya Oku’s manga, he can count on
Noritake Kinashi, world famous at home as one half of a singing comedy duo.
His co-star is Takeru Satoh, well-known for the Rurouni Kenshin-films (BIFFF

The latter are the Asian version of the Avenger’s Tessert act. They would ensure the total eradication
of those pesky humans. However, there’s one small issue. Said pearls are in Ni Kongkong’s possession.
And Ni is a small-time crook who doesn’t realize his new balls have such destructive power.
In the early 2000s, inspired by Lord of the Rings, seven Chinese writers created a
new fantasy world. Novoland was born, an imaginary, elaborate and very detailed
universe. It’s a clever mix between traditional wuxia and heroic fantasy. Surely,
Novoland is a dream come true for all fantasy buffs. It didn’t take long for written poetry
to be transformed into visual prose. Legend of the Naga Pearls is the feature debut of
Yang Lei. And he could count on Gordon Chan (Painted Skin, The Medallion, The
Four) to take the production reigns. The dazzling sfx were taken care of by the entire

In chaos theory (and of course in science fiction flicks) it refers to
the fact that minimal changes in a given situation can later cause gigantic problems. In 2095, the

Man Divided is a prime example of intelligent science fiction. The ecological

This epic movie is one of the big Russian hits of 2018. Surrounded by critical
acclaim, The Scythian wasn’t even completed when it got sold internationally.
Some think of Apocalypto, others regard it as a worthy successor of Gladiator.
We at the BIFFF see it as a pagan Mad Max, a visual fantasy from a Russian

the ex-infected have to face hatred and discrimination. Some even want to intern them in camps.
And then there are the 25% who cannot be cured. While the army starts to impose a final solution,
some of the cured turn to violence to be heard.
In his debut feature, director David Freyne uses the allegory of the infected as a
metaphor for social discrimination. It reminds you of The Revenants, but here
the filmmaker adds a political layer. His subtext is quite flexible and allows
him to give xenophobes, neo-liberals and eurosceptics the finger. As you will
have understood by now, The Cured is far from being an ordinary zombie-flick.
Carried by the incredible Ellen Page (Inception, Hard Candy) and acclaimed by
international critics, it is almost your duty to come and watch it at the BIFFF!"

Milutin is a skilled astronaut working for the Ederlezi Corporation. He just finished his training
to participate in the most dangerous mission ever; an expedition to Alpha Centauri, the only planet
suitable for human life. As the journey is going to be very long, the astronaut might risk getting bored.
The Ederlezi Corporation has provided a partner for Milutin. Nimani is an android adapted to the
astronaut’s psychological profile. Because of Milutin’s misogynist nature, his sexualized tamagochi is
in serious risk of breaking down before they reach their destination. Thousand light years away from Earth,
Milutin feels like a god with his remote controlling Nimani’s desires. She evolves from colleague to lover and
from lover to sexual slave. As boundaries are being broken, Milutin’s lust for domination can no longer be
fulfilled by a piece of software. He decides to reboot Nimani and to implant the final touch: real emotions!
Ederlezi Rising, aesthetically reminding us of Tarkovski’s Solaris, is a bold
science-fiction movie from Serbia. Our Serbian friends are not known to hold
back when it comes to cinema (A Serbian Film, anyone!?) and in Ederlezi Rising
they live up to their reputation. Lazar Bodroza’s first feature delves deeply into
our most primal desires. It also evokes fellow countrywoman and renowned
shock-artist Marina Abramovic’s 1974 performance, where she let herself be
abused by the audience. Adult movie enthusiasts will recognize Stoya, who has
put her porn career aside to put us men firmly in our place."

the early 19th century, has quite a special demon. For years, he’s been fighting off a low-level
devil to whom he once pledged his soul and who wants to present him with a one-way ticket
to hell. In order to buy time, Patxi has locked up the horned creature in his smithy, which is as
dark as night and as hot as a furnace. The pious and superstitious village where he lives shuns
the smith as if he were a leper, but then Usue enters the scene. As the young daughter of a woman
who killed herself, she too is being snubbed by the closed community. Usue becomes the bone of
contention between the smith, the demon, and the villagers. Maybe she will succeed in keeping
the gates of hell closed for just a while longer…
A horror story in the Basque country and spoken in Euskera (the Basque
language), that’s something we don’t get to see every day. This production by
BIFFF regulars Álex de la Iglesia and Carolina Bang is the first full-fledged
film by writer-director Paul Urkijo Alijo. His Errementari (“blacksmith”) is an

raped at least 3,000 times. In the dramatized film version, we meet an imperturbable woman
who hides a terrible family secret. Writer and director André de Lorde, nicknamed “The Prince
of Terror”, practically keeps her under lock and key with the help of a psychiatrist. Until one day, a
young journalist pays a visit for an article he’s writing and he starts suspecting the famous theatre
is somehow involved with a series of gruesome murders. Upon meeting Paula, he falls head over
heels in love and he also learns about her painful past. Will he be able to save her from the clutches
of the shady characters surrounding her?
The name Franck Ribière may not ring a bell, but what if we told you he’s the
producer of Álex de la Iglesia (Witching and Bitching, The Perfect Crime, The

hundred thousand soldiers and Chourov is in the middle of it.
Frontier, dedicated to Operation Iskra, about the breaking of the siege of
Leningrad, is a gigantic project that took ten years to complete. It’s a patriotic
homage to the sacrifice of Russian soldiers and a fantastic blockbuster about
time jumps. Dmitriy Tyurin’s film is a maze of stories, from the most intimate to
the most epic. This visually astounding adventure (with a budget of 300 Rubles,
you do the math) could count on a crack team of sfx artists (responsible for a.o.

It’s been a long time since we heard something from John Cameron Mitchell, who

weren’t expecting this high-class movie. Starring Elle Fanning (groundbreaking

Killing God, which won the Audience Award at the latest Sitges film festival,

It’s a pitch black comedy with a religious alibi, in the vein of Álex de la Iglesia’s

You might think you’re getting a new version of Cluedo, but Jack Eve’s second film
can not be reduced to just an adaptation. Bees Make Honey is wildly original
and visually sumptuous, as if Baz Luhrmann had his way with Agatha Christie.
It’s a lyrical ode to the whodunit film, a feast of narrative and visual styles. And

Italian filmmaker Paolo Genovese made a huge impression with his black

to do with chocolate - Belgian, Greek, or otherwise). One day he’s found quite dead in the
luxurious country estate where he holds court with his extended family. According to the will, his
trophy wife stands to inherit everything, but Sophie smells a rat. It turns out that just about every
family member has their own personal reason for offing granddad… Our Sherlock will have an
uphill task finding the real culprit!
We have known French filmmaker Gilles Paquet-Brenner ever since his
murderously efficient horror thriller Walled In (BIFFF 2009). In Crooked
House, he adapts the ever so British Agatha Christie. He attacks the convoluted
plot with lots of style and an impressive list of acting talents, including Glenn
Close (Fatal Attraction), Christina Hendricks (Mad Men), Max Irons (The Host),
Terence Stamp (The Adjustment Bureau), Gillian Anderson (The X Files), and
Julian Sands (Warlock)."

Inside are Todd ( Rod Hernandez ) and Sara ( Alexa
Yeames ), a young couple toting around a bunch of strangers who pitched in gas money to
reach everyone’s shared destination. When trying to repair the flat tire, the friendly and helpful
Jeff gets shot, but no shooter is in sight. Panic breaks out in this group of people who barely
know each other’s names. At such a time you can trust no one! For a couple of years now, we’ve
been trying to tell you cars aren’t your best friends. Remember Monolith ( 2017 ) ? Well, once more
we have a desert, a car, and some people who possibly will die! And you still want to do that road
trip in the Sierra Nevada ?
Behind the camera is an old friend of the festival. Ryuhei Kitamura won a Silver
Raven in 2003 with Aragami, a sublime tale about samurais revealing their true
identity. He is also well-known for Azumi (2003) and the slasher The Midnight
Meat Train (2008). In this minimalistic thriller, he once again reveals his
sublime talent for suspense and mise-en-scène."

But when danger occurs, she gets
possessed by the ghost of Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson’s character in Taken). “Danger” here means
a group of six lunatic drug sellers, whom she saw killing a cop on duty. There remains but one
thing to do : kill that poor little helpless girl. What they haven’t bargained for is that Emma has
seen all the Kill Bill movies and is in for some good ol’ ultra violence.
Hunting Emma, the first movie by South African director Byron Davis, is based
on a novel by Deon Meyer. The film doesn’t have the budget of its examples, but
it makes up for that by a resourceful way of filming, with omnipresent violence, a
breathtaking rhythm, and an impressive Leandie De Randt. Neill Blomkamp, you

given up his hobby: getting rid of society’s scum. But as to his daughter’s boyfriend, with his
murderer’s face and sanctimonious grin... he doesn’t trust him for one bit. In order to get to the
bottom of this, he will have to deal with his failing memory, which has more holes in it than a ripe
Swiss cheese. And all the things he remembers from his past, did they really happen ?
In South Korea, Memoir of a Murderer attracted more than two million
spectators in less than two weeks. The success is no doubt due to the dynamic
direction by Won Shin-yun, who forces you to see the world through the eyes of a
serial killer. But the excellent performances certainly add to the effect. Among the
actors, we recognize Kyung-gu Sol from Cold Eyes (BIFFF 2014), whereas Dalsu
Oh played in Tunnel (BIFFF 2017), Veteran (BIFFF 2016), and the instant
classic Oldboy."

Jo Hyun-Woo is 15. He is a good kid, who may no longer believe in Santa but
does believe in justice. That’s bad luck for him, as good cops decide to arrest him for the murder
of a taxi driver. He might be innocent, but a few punches in the face from the arm of the law
make him confess to anything. 16 years later, Jo Hyun-Woo has done his time in jail, but he’s
damaged goods. No one wants to hire him, his mother has become blind and is having trouble
putting food on the table and insurances companies want to rob him blind for victim compensation.
That’s when he meets Lee Jun-Young, a lawyer who used to plead pro bono, who dreams of a more
lucrative professional future. But the more the lawyer digs into the case, the more he realizes that
he’s drowning in a sea of corruption.
Kim Tae-Yun promised he would never again deal with stories based on true
events that stigmatize injustice and corruption in Korea after his 2014 movie
Another Family. Nonetheless, the filmmaker couldn’t resist. Not only is New
Trial based on real events, the trial is still ongoing! Cleverly, Kim does not look
into the trial itself, but he untangles the web of a legal system that is rotten to the
core. In the end, the Korean director offers a breath-taking thriller which will
want you to make the world a better place."

bomb attacks spark fear among Hong Kong’s citizens, the clever policeman quickly smells a rat.
Blast is challenging him to a cat-and-mouse game: will you be able to deactivate this bomb

no-goods, Blast takes hold of a major underground tunnel, including a hundred or so hostages, and
he threatens to blast everything to smithereens if his demands aren’t met. Will our bold-hearted
hero succeed in defusing the situation in time?
Andy Lau needs no further introduction for the BIFFF public. The star of House
of Flying Daggers and Infernal Affairs 1 and 3 is the unmistakable center of
gravity in this energetic and tightly paced thriller. Director Herman Yau is no
unknown quantity either because we previously saw his Gong Tau (BIFFF
2008), Ghost Within (BIFFF 2006), and Troublesome Night (BIFFF 2000). A

expelled from school for bad behaviour, doesn’t want to heed her good advice either. And what to
do about the public prosecutor, who has vowed to bring the gangsters down because they don’t
want to return his sex tape ?
A Special Lady is a hard-boiled crime drama, a genre which the Koreans seem
to have monopolized these last 15 years. It boasts enough plot developments to
fill ten movies, impressive performances, stylish direction, a pulsating rhythm…
Lee An-gyu used to assist Kim Jee-woon (I Saw the Devil, A Bittersweet Life, A

by his newspaper because of the fake scandal. At his most vulnerable he’ll have to go at it alone to
uncover the dirty truth.
Who Killed Cock Robin ? is the second film by Taiwanese director Wei-Hao

In 2013, we presented Pastorela, a wonderfully weird picture where Good

opposites are back again in Emilio Portes’ newest film, but humor has taken a

Guillermo Amoedo, a close collaborator of Eli Roth, has written scripts such as
The Green Inferno and Knock Knock. You might also remember The Stranger,

Man Bites Dog, The Blair Witch Project, and other Cloverfields. With a combination of found footage,

extreme measures. Not exactly someone we care to meet at midnight in a dark alley… but in
a dark movie theater we rather like this kinda fella! In a previous life, Marco Laguna (a.k.a. Marc

organize as best they can.
Ex funeris by Walloon filmmaker Alexandre Drouet is not just a genre
quickie. Rather than the umpteenth cheap zombie flick, this intelligently
constructed film is a profound reflection on consumer society and the place of
man in it. Thanks to Drouet’s lo-fi approach and no-nonsense black-and-white
photography, his apocalyptic story ends up having more in common with The
Road than with Mad Max or World War Z."

The BIFFF presents the very first feminist “huis-clos” ever made! This
reflection on a misogynist near-future society is brought to us by two Brussels’
expats, Ioana Mattei and Christopher Morrison. Intertwining dystopia and
psychological thriller, Joanne, which was entirely shot in our beautiful capital, is
driven by Alex Reid’s impressive performance. There are also some big names in

A birthday party by the swimming pool is the perfect setting to ventilate the

with the Indians. Take for instance Baahubali: The Conclusion, the continuation of Baahubali:
The Beginning (logical, ain’t it?). When the royal prince Mahendra discovers the truth about his
murdered father, he vows revenge against the tyrannical ruler of the kingdom, his own uncle.
In between all this, we learn how things got that far. It’s a tale full of family feuds, pitched battles,
and romance told with the world-renowned Indian sense of quiet minimalism…
Got you there! The gods will be whizzing past your ears in this spectacular
mythological epic from Tollywood, the Indian film industry in Telugu (75 million
speakers!) that can compete with Bollywood. Beautiful photography, eyewatering
effects, impressive locations, dazzling martial arts, overwhelming mass
scenes, lovely choreographies, flawless camera work, sentimental romance….
You could use an extra pair of eyes and ears to take it all in. S.S. Rajamouli,
known for Baahubali: The Beginning (BIFFF 2016) and Eega (BIFFF 2014),

A mild-mannered man has a close encounter
with an alien, who thanks him kindly by taking possession of his body. His wife is not amused
and she can’t fathom why he quits his job and bumbles about with a hollow stare and a stupid
grin. Something is profoundly wrong, that much is clear. Meanwhile, we meet a freelance
journalist investigating a murder case. He makes the acquaintance of a bizarre young man and
a teenage girl, but soon realizes they’re extraterrestrials. It turns out they’re the advance guard of a
large-scale invasion which will see Planet Earth completely colonized. The journalist now has the
biggest scoop of the millennium, but what to do with it? Should he inform the authorities or rather
seek his own glory by taking sides with the aliens?
Introducing Kiyoshi Kurosawa is like throwing water into the sea. With films
like Cure, Charisma, and Pulse, the Japanese filmmaker helped make J-Horror a
worldwide phenomenon. In Before We Vanish, which is hilarious and tragic in
equal measure, he leaves his comfort zone and ventures into science fiction for the
first time. But not without infusing the genre with his trademark eerie look and

story of Mark, a grizzled LAPD cop ( played by Frank Grillo ) who is taking his son home after
a night in jail. Little do they know that while sitting in the subway an alien attack will take
place… Long story short: the son gets sucked up by the aliens’ ship in an old-school kind of
way and in order to get his son back dad is willing to kill every little c*cks*cking alien. What
follows is a feast for the action-loving filmgoer, with guest appearances by two actors from The
Raid ( Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhain ).
Let’s be honest about it, you don’t watch this kind of movie for the plot, but for
the spectacle. And boy does this one deliver ! Beyond Skyline wasn’t filmed with
a big Hollywood budget but it still looks stunning, thanks to lots of classic effects
in the slimy interiors of the cavernous spaceship and the H.R. Giger-inspired,
skeletal-looking alien monsters, all of this mixed up with crafty CGI. Director
Liam O’Donnell, who wrote and produced the first Skyline, put all his skills on
the table. Having worked on the visual effects of movies like Iron Man 2 and
Alien vs Predator, this guy sets the bar pretty high when it comes to mixing CGI

You’ll probably see a few kangaroos but that quickly gets boring. So, all that’s left to do is
farm cattle or drink your way through the heat. Ken and Blue decide to do both as they guard
their sheep while gulping down some brewskis. Our jumping friends are no danger to their
herd but dingoes certainly are and the duo have had it with the beasts. Encouraged by their beer
consumption, they decide it’s time to teach the wild dogs a lesson and they set off into the desert.
After a few miles they come across a polluted camping site and curse those stupid city folk who
have no respect for nature. Seriously, who leaves a leg in the bushes, a head on a camping pole and
blood all over the ground?! By the time they realize what they’re looking at and understand that no
dingo could have done this, it’s already too late. A monster is coming and by the sound it’s making
the only option left is to… run!
Asking if Boar would be a good fit for the BIFFF was but a rhetorical question. Who
wouldn’t want to? Especially when it comes from Chris Sun, the guy who sweetened
up our appetites with Charlie’s Farm (BIFFF 2015). Get ready for a creature feature
that’ll give Russel Mulcahey’s legendary Razorback a run for its money!"

continues his mission in the outside world. But just as he is close to his goal a godforsaken
fortune teller throws him a curse. A few gun wounds later he falls asleep in the hospital only to
wake up… in the body of a newborn! Cursing his bodily limitations and his mushy parents he has
to wait a year before he is ready to reopen the case. And now that he can finally speak and doesn’t
shit his pants anymore, he is unstoppable! It’s with the voice of an old Clint Eastwood that he reveals
himself to his adoptive father Oleg, a policeman too. Although he seems impressive, compared to
his son snuggled into a maxy cosy, he’s the Punisher of petty crimes. But he’s our ex-special forces
agent only hope. Igor has no choice but to guide Oleg into the world of treacherous whores, hard
drugs and daily executions.
Since Freaky Friday, body swapping has almost become a genre of its own.
But this time our Russian friends have spiced it up a little with a pinch of The
Boss Baby and Lethal Weapon. The result is a feel good-fantasy movie with a
Vladivostok twist."

The incorruptible cop never runs out of citizens to save or crimes to solve. And there’s his tragic

obsession. All leads have turned into dead ends. Then, one fateful night, Corbin discovers
that he comes from a long line of demon hunters. Queeny and Vince, two suspects with an
unquenchable thirst for blood, could have something to do with him being an orphan. It’s time to
follow in his parents’ footsteps.
Corbin Nash, directed by Ben Jagger and co-written with his brother Dean
S. Jagger (Game of Thrones, Travelers), is a love letter to vintage B-movies, a
clash between Death Wish and The Lost Boys. Todd Matthew Grossman (Mad
Max: Fury Road, John Wick) held the production reins, while an entire legion
of genre veterans make their appearance: Rutger Hauer, Malcolm Mc Dowell,
Druce Davision and Corey Feldman, the latter in a succulent over-the-top
performance as a transvestite bloodsucker. This world premiere is a bloody must

long as they are on the drug because the consequences would be disastrous. But when one
of them wilfully hurts an ant, they get their comeuppance in the form of a non-stop attack
by killer ants. And each time they kill one, his siblings come back bigger and deadlier. Before they
know what’s what, they’re running for their dear life, while at the same time fighting off the cruel
creatures. Till the bitter ant !
Dead Ant is an entertaining, no-nonsense horror comedy that looks like an update
of 1950s monster movies. Among the actors, we recognize some well-known
faces from B movie fun and recent TV series. Jake Busey (From Dusk till Dawn,
Starship Troopers) is one of the band members and Michael Horse (Twin Peaks
1990 and 2017) is the peyote-providing Indian, while good old Tom Arnold (True

night ahead. When Jim and Lulu strike up a genuine bond, their future rests entirely on her conscience
and whether or not she’ll betray her sister and warn Jim and Alex of their nefarious intentions.
For his first feature, filmmaker Benjamin Barfoot has to perform a difficult
balancing act between horror and comedy, familiar terrain from Shaun of the
Dead and other Sightseers. He tries it with an inventive visual style and he can
also count on the clever, playful screenplay by male lead Danny Morgan (On the
Road). The film made it to various top 10 lists and was even nominated for a
British Independent Film Award. Mission accomplished!"

coldly crushing his crown jewels and leaving him literally hanging on... because the elevator
is stuck between floors and won’t budge. At the same time, Rome succumbs to acute zombie
fever and before long Claudio has to witness how his colleagues perish by the dozen at the hands
of bloodthirsty monsters. Soon they set their sights on him too and he has to fend off the hellish

The End ? was produced by the Manetti Bros. Antonio and Marco are no
strangers to the BIFFF crowd because previously we showed Paura 3D ( 2013 ),
The Arrival of Wang ( 2012 ), and Zora the Vampire ( 2002 ). As the foulmouthed
protagonist, we recognize Alessandro Roja, known from television
series like Romanzo criminale and 1992. Director Daniele Misischia gets the
most out of his claustrophobic location in this infectious contemporary zombie
tale, told with the raw energy of a B movie."

Russian horror cinema is not new and at the BIFFF we’re aware that it’s
up and coming. But The Envelope creates a unique setting through strong
cinematographic images. Svyatoslav Podgaevskiy’s The Bride, shown at the
festival last year, was bought by the Americans for a remake. We hope The
Envelope will have the same fate. This might be Vladimir Markov’s first movie,
but he certainly has a nose for acting talent. Standing out in this bewitching

well-known in their country, but still have to be discovered over here. Will Mother

Fed up
with police oppression in the middle of Apartheid, they defended themselves with harmless slingshots.
Until the fatal day when one of them took a weapon and sent two white cops six feet underground.
His name was Tau and nobody has ever seen him since... Twenty years later, Tau is back in town.
Incognito. Keeping a very low profile. His friends are still there, they became mayor, cop and priest.
The fifth one is at the cemetery. Nobody forgot what Tau did and nobody forgave him either. The city has
changed, however: Even after the end of white oppression, corruption is still well established and Ghost,
the new self-proclaimed sheriff, has put everyone on a regime of terror... Tau only seeks the calm and
redemption of his friends. Over the last twenty years, he has piled up enough bullshit, not only to fill an
entire prison but also to receive a nickname that shudders the entire country: the “Lion of Marseilles”. And
nobody wants to wake the beast...
Five Fingers for Marseilles, a clearly tribute to classical westerns, transposes
Sergio Leone’s mythical universe to post-Apartheid South Africa with its majestic
landscapes. Michael Matthews can be proud of his debut feature : complete
immersion in the story, very present archetypes, polished plans that are waiting for
a harmonica fragment to enter legend; this modern version of the lonely cowboy
will inspire awe and admiration!"

Flashburn deals with the implications of deadly viruses that spread globally
like wildfires. But don’t expect a dry doom and gloom scenario, rather a taut
existential thriller about a man racing against time. A few years ago, the Belgian-
American filmmaker Giorgio Serafini surprised the BIFFF audience with The
Between (2013) and he’s also collaborated with stars like Wesley Snipes (Game

The immensely popular manga Gintama has already been turned into animation
twice, but this is the first live-action adaptation. The whacky plot, a postmodern
mix of period swashbuckler and science fiction, was entrusted to director Yuichi
Fukuda (Hentai Kamen 2). He keeps up a punishing pace and also plays off the
absurdist humor and psychedelic atmosphere. The protagonist is none other than
Shun Oguri, known for his work with Takashi Miike (Sukiyaki Western Django,

For his 23rd film, Ki-duk Kim had a clear message: “I made this film to stop

completely threw all politically correct caution in the wind. It didn’t take long for
reactions to flood in. The world premiere of Human Space, Time and Human at

plain evil ! Set in Ireland in the early 1920s, The Lodgers tells the story of twins living in a house
controlled by “lodgers”, evil spirits that give them three rules: be in bed before midnight, never
bring strangers home, and don’t try to escape because you’ll put your sibling’s life in danger.
And you thought your parents where too strict when you were a kid ? Of course one of the
twins gets a crush on a brave soldier returning from combat and things start getting out of hand.
The rules aren’t being observed and her brother’s lifespan is getting shorter… This is a Cinderella
story, but told with the right purpose: to scare children !
The Lodgers is the newest feature by acclaimed director Brian O’Malley, who
with Let Us Prey won the Silver Méliès at the BIFFF 2014. Once more he proves
that the haunting meadows of Scotland and Ireland provide an ideal location for
frightening horror."

This so-called gift
frightens her above anything else, for she knows that it is part of a curse which befell her family
some time ago. Trying by all means to stay as far away from the curse as possible, she takes
refuge in a convent where she is ready to renounce the pleasures of the flesh. But that all falls
apart when she learns that her mother has committed suicide. Back home she must face her
unbalanced sister, who has decided that they must embark on a journey together. But this isn’t a
bonding trip for siblings. It’s much more peculiar than that. They must enter the heart of the jungle
and ingest an ancestral hallucinogen to purge their souls. The drug has drastic side effects when it
unleashes the demons within the sisters.
Gonzalo Calzada, one of Argentina’s most prominent genre directors, has proven
himself once again. Only two years after Resurrection (2016), the most watched
horror movie in his home country, he delights us with his most recent feature.
Luciferina is the first entry of what is to become “the virgin trilogy”, a treat for
horror fans all around the world. The film provides ancestral drugs, pagan rites
and a perverted version of the eternal battle between Good and Evil."

While his co-workers enjoy
the Christmas party, this nerd is crunching numbers in his tiny office. When his boss asks his
help with an urgent year-end report, Michael is flattered. Just one catch – it needs to be done
by Christmas. The stack of research arrives with his boss’ beautiful assistant Cindy. Michael
is smitten and when she invites him to join her family for a traditional Christmas celebration,
he is simply over the moon. While there, a spiked glass of eggnog lands Michael in the family’s
basement with his hands and feet bound. He is presented with an ultimatum: deliver the year-end
report or suffer the way those before him have suffered. If he doesn’t escape, Cindy’s family will be
having him for Christmas dinner!
It took screenwriter-producer-director Ryan Nelson seven years to turn his
short Mercy Christmas into a full-length feature, but it was worth the wait. This
unusual addition to the all-American Christmas movie genre (think How the
Grinch Stole Christmas, The Polar Express or A Christmas Carol) charms the
viewer with its unique mix of spine-tingling scares and hilarious humor."

restore peace to the Monster Kingdom and such destiny coming with a whole lot of danger.
Pursued by both the Monster Bureau and unscrupulous bounty hunters, Wuba will not be
able to face all his enemies. Fortunately for him, Wuba meets BenBen, an adult version of his own
species, who’ll protect him and will do everything to get him back to his parents.
After taking over the Chinese box office with the first episode, Raman Hui, who
earned his stripes at Dreamworks, does it again. But rather than copy-pasting
the first part, Hui introduces new and exciting characters to the mix, helped by a
legion of 33 special effects wizards, who’ve proved their worth in interplanetary
hits such as Star Wars and Pacific Rim. He shows incredible skill in mixing CGI
characters and live action, creating a fantastic adventure for the entire family."

Montreal Dead End is an anthology feature composed of fifteen shorts. One short

divine creatures were maleficent ? Writer and literature professor Samuel Salomon has barely
come to terms with the suicide of his sexy young girlfriend, when he is plagued by a series of
nightmares, in which a woman is ritually sacrificed. Upon learning that his dreams have become
reality, he visits the scene of the crime, where he meets another woman who’s had the very same

members are few, because most of them died under suspicious circumstances. Verses by famous
poets were found on their bodies, burned into their flesh by a tattoo artist who didn’t particularly

The literary horror thriller Muse is signed by Jaume Balagueró, Catalan genre
maestro and a regular visitor to the BIFFF. Just think of the [REC]-tetralogy,
Sleep Tight, and Darkness. For this Belgian co-production, he relies on a sublime
cast, with among others Franka Potente (Anatomy 1 & 2, Jason Bourne 1 & 2),
Leonor Watling (The Oxford Murders, Hable con ella), and the indestructible
Christopher Lloyd (The Addams Family, Back to the Future-trilogy)."

company that praises the life-saving virtues of its vaccines. The problem is that the company
is run like a crime syndicate. And they are about to flood the African continent with some very
harmful vaccines. Anyone who dares to lift a finger, ends up with said finger and the rest of his
body in an acid bath. So, in Mikkeli, people only talk about mosquitoes and snow. Then, one day, a
certain Rendel decides to clean things up. He’s vicious, brutal, ruthless and incredibly violent. The
masked avenger causes so much damage to Vala’s more muscled employees, that they hire an elite
squad of international killers to finish off Rendel. After all, the company has to make sure people
keep talking about mosquitoes and snow.
It has been a rumor for years, but now it’s finally happening: the very first
Finnish superhero! Written, produced and directed by Jesse Haaja, Rendel
is obviously influenced by The Punisher, Darkman and Christopher Nolan’s
Batman. This first Scandinavian excursion into masked avengers’ territory is
bloody and disturbing but full of dark humor. Please allows us, because we feel

Uncle Lloyd is back at the BIFFF, four years after treating us to to the insane,
provocative and outrageous, boobs, pus and blood fest that was Return to Nuke
‘Em High: volume 1. This time he returns with a thoughtful, politically correct
intimate drama about a man, a harmonica and an inflatable cat trapped in
a public toilet during the holidays. No, just kidding. As Toxie shouted when
he kicked the Donald down the well: “This is Troma!”. Return to Return to
Nuke ‘Em High aka Vol 2 is a movie with a message about the contamination

this once-in-a-lifetime experience, let’s look at how the main protagonists get through the

her boyfriend Nathan ( Matt Dellapina ). They are joined by four strangers eager to see if the Slasher
Sleepout is as scary as people say. After just a few hours, the first blood is shed and panic takes
over. Is this a game or the demonic plan of a serial killer ? Who knows, but we’ll have lots of fun
watching it enfold!
Ruin Me is the perfect festival movie. It’s fast-paced, full of funny dialogues,
and the setting is right on the nose. After experimenting with short films and TV

flick with Robin Williams a while back ? ). Forget about that, now it means “resurrected victim”
: a murder victim who returns among the living because he or she isn’t satisfied with the
punishment that was meted out to their assassin. What you call an undead, right ? It seems
that in South Korea they can’t get rid of them… Seo is an ambitious young prosecutor who’s
got it all worked out, until his mother, killed in a robbery some years ago, turns up again and attacks
him with a knife. Because he rather cherishes his life, he sets out to find out what really happened.
Gradually he discovers unpleasant things about his own past, obscured by the alcohol fumes of his
graduation party years ago.
Nothing is quite what it seems in the nail-biting horror thriller RV: Resurrected
Victims, which plays an intricate game with different time layers. Director Kyungtaek
Kwak (Friend, Doctor K) is an old hand of the Korean film industry. For his
latest film, he has assembled a dream cast. We recognize Rae-won Kim from The
Prison (BIFFF 2017) and Hye-jin Jeon from The Terror Live (BIFFF 2015). The
part of the avenging mother is being played by none other than Korea’s leading
lady Hae-suk Kim (see also New Trial), who featured in Park Chan-wook’s The
Handmaiden and a host of other movies."

Finally, the millennials have their own horror movie. This feature film is actually
a follow-up to a two-minute short internet buzz by the same director, made in

She will soon realize her power. Far from being a vulgar prisoner, she is a true goddess, and her
followers are at her mercy. That is until another woman claims to be the real Sunny. What starts as
a pitched battle on social networks, soon turns to carnage.
You might think that director Kazuya Shiraishi (The Devil’s Path) wants to teach
us a lesson about our social media obsessed society, but nothing could be further
from the truth. What you get is mind boggling psychedelic satire, which puts him
on the same par with Takashi Miike en Sion Sono, who also couldn’t care less

In 2013, we already had Shinobu Yaguchi’s clever-cute Robo-G and now he

This is probably the most violent and deranging movie since A Serbian Film.
Director and writer Lucio A. Rojas (Sendero) transcribes the horror unleashed

troops are retreating like frightened rabbits, making their campsites look like the aftermath of a
particularly bloody party. This is a unique opportunity for the Allies to go rummaging through
the mythical trench 11, which is the subject of horrifying rumors that make all the hairs on your
body stand up. Berton, a Canadian sapper, is in charge of guiding a squad of soldiers through
this underground labyrinth that the Germans didn’t manage to destroy before leaving. They expect
something bad lurking here, but nothing could have prepared them for the horde of mutant soldiers
created by a twisted visionary of the future Third Reich.
You smell it, that sweet smell of Dead Snow: Red VS Dead and Frankenstein’s
Army, don’t you? Well, Leo Scherman has created a similar atmosphere in his
latest film. This former trainee of David Cronenberg treats us to a claustrophobic
experience stuffed with hungry mutants. Welcome to Trench 11, where The
Great Escape meets The Descent! You’d better play some Wolfenstein first to
prepare you for what’s ahead."
2018,movie ,50 years of Belgian Cinema,,TUEURS,"François Troukens, Jean-Francois Hensgens",2017,Belgium,Retro,,"Olivier Gourmet, Lubna Azabal , Kevin Janssens ",,,,,,,86',thriller,,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt6901252,?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_9",,,,,"The international media were
quick to pick it up. Tueurs
was as interesting behind the
scenes as in front of the camera.
François Troukens, scriptwriter
and co-director with Jean-François
Hensgens, was himself a notorious
gangster in the 90ties. Tueurs
is, of course, inspired by the (still
unresolved) bloodbaths of the
Brabant Killers in the 80ties and by
the bombing on the Bologna train
station in 1980. This ruthless crime
thriller premiered at the Venice
Film Festival before filling up seats
in Belgian cinemas. And that’s
something that can only make us
proud.
Frank Valken is a gangster who has always
followed a strict moral code: no bodies and
as less violence as possible. After what is
supposed to be his last score, he already sees
himself retiring under a palmtree. But what
looked like a smooth robbery, turns into a
nightmare when a much more violent gang
reappears after decades of silence. The corpses
are piling up, among whom a magistrate
who uinvestigated the notorious affair of the
Mad Shooters. Valken and his gang are now
suddenly blamed for the bloody murders."

a solar eclipse! Verónica ( Vero for her friends ) is having a rough time. Her father is long gone
and since her mother works impossible shifts in a bar she has to play mommy to her sisters
and bed-wetting little brother. At her strict nun school ( it’s the 1980s in a still very religious
Spain ) she sneaks off with two friends while everybody else is on the roof staring at the sun.
Via a Ouija board the girls try and make contact with the deceased and lo and behold, they have a
supernatural visitor. But the guest outstays his welcome and during the next few days, he plays a
destructive game with his new-found friend Vero…
Paco Plaza needs no introduction because ever since his first effort Second Name
( 2002 ) he’s been a BIFFF regular. Verónica, based on a true story, is his followup
to the legendary REC movies, shot in collaboration with his Catalan blood
brother Jaime Balagueró. Once more he serves a masterful cocktail of demonic
possession and nail-biting suspense, seasoned with just the right amount of
religious hysteria. The impressive young actors are joined by Anna Torrent

you’ll be able to laugh your ass off. Vidar is 33 – the age at which Jesus Christ became a
superstar. This sturdy farm boy still lives and works with his strictly religious mother. But
he’s fed up with country life and dreams of wild rolls in the hay with voluptuous women. In
a moment of despair, he prays to God to release him. After a nightly vision, during which he
meets a babe with horns and a Christ figure with vampire teeth, he wakes up with a hangover. All
of a sudden he’s become allergic to sunlight, so he outsources the farm and moves to the city, where
he indulges in a life of debauchery. Maybe a session with a therapist will finally bring redemption ?
Ever since his childhood, Thomas Aske Berg has had only one wish: to play in a
vampire movie. Unfortunately, there’s no such tradition in Norway, so what did
he do? He wrote, produced and directed Vidar the Vampire, the very first one,
and while he was at it he also played the leading part and wrote the soundtrack.
The result is a wacky horror comedy which pokes fun at sex, religion, and the
Norway of life."

the vicinity of the Buenos Aires. It used to be a cozy vacation resort until it got submerged by flood
waters and was completely abandoned. The youngsters want to shoot a documentary in the eerie
ghost town, where one of them used to live as a young girl. But things quickly get out of hand when
their van breaks down and they discover that they’re not exactly alone. A family of primitive sadists
(the living embodiment of centuries of incest and inbreeding) have decided they want to have a bit of
fun at their expense. Stashed away in their headquarters El Matadero (Spanish for “slaughterhouse”)
sit all kinds of torture devices, which they can finally test on these first-rate laboratory rabbits. Before
long the hip city-dwellers wonder why for fuck’s sake they didn’t stay at home.
The Onetti Brothers are the new wonder boys of the Argentinian horror scene.
And they keep everything in the family : screenwriting, directing, producing,
editing, and composing. In Sonno profondo and Francesca they explored the
giallo genre (honoring their Italian roots) and now they sink their teeth in slasher
fare like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. Among the
actors, we recognize Argentinian scream queen Victoria Maurette and horror

Soon. Britain is in a civil war as the State battles rebel militia for power.
A woman wakes up in a blindingly white cuboid room: the White Chamber. A voice from the
outside demands information, but she claims to have none. To gain the answers he seeks, her
captor utilises the gruesome functionality of the White Chamber as an instrument of torture. The
temperature within the space shifts between the extremes; water, acid and even electricity fire
out of the floor and ceiling. The woman’s mind, body and soul are pushed to their limit. The woman
begins to talk to her captor… but is she just surviving or does she know more?
The dystopian White Chamber is an elevated genre hybrid combining sci-fi,
thriller, horror and drama elements, while taking Milgram’s controversial social
psychology experiments to a new level. White Chamber is 25-year-old Paul
Rashid’s second movie after Servants’ Quarters from 2016. As your damsel in
distress, we give you no one other than Shauna Macdonald (The Descent, Howl,

1974 with a series of highly original, raunchy comedies. These movies, independent precursors
to such later smash hits as National Lampoon’s Animal House and Porky’s, did well financially,
although Kaufman continued to work on such outside productions as Rocky and Saturday Night
Fever. Kaufman’s relationship with mainstream Hollywood would not last long. In 1984, Lloyd
finally gets his breakthrough movie, The Toxic Avenger. The success of The Toxic Avenger was
followed by a string of commercial and artistic triumphs in a similar vein, blending fantasy,
heavy action, comedy, and eroticism in a style that can only be described as “Tromatic”. These
films, including the Class of Nuke ‘Em High trilogy, Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, and Troma’s War, were
often ignored or scorned by the intelligentsia of the time but spoke to an entire generation of
young people who rejected the pandering, commercial films of the mid-to-late 80’s. Some of
these Troma fans went on to become filmmakers themselves, including Quentin Tarantino, Kevin
Smith, Mike Judge, Peter Jackson, and Trey Parker. Thanks to these admirers, Kaufman has been

blood from an early age. However it wasn’t until his thirties that Chris decided to write and
direct horror films. His first experience as a film writer, producer and director was his debut
feature “Come and Get Me” in 2010. But it was in 2012, that his second feature film, “Daddy’s
Little Girl” sent ripples throughout the independent film industry in Australia and made waves
internationally. Where most horror filmmakers struggle with practical special effects, Chris excels
adding more production value to his projects by drawing on his extensive Special FX artist skill
set. No wonder Chris is fast becoming “the master of horror” in Australia. Chris’ next film project
in 2018 called “BOAR” is a story of a monster pig the size of a mini van which rampages through
the Australian outback destroying anything and killing anyone is his path. With the success of
Charlie’s Farm Internationally Universal Pictures Australia were quick to secure the Australian
Distribution rights for BOAR. Chris Sun’s directing style is certainly putting Australia foremost
as the home of great solid genre films.",,,,,,,,,,Director,,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4285728/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0,,,,,

the University of Morón. In 2006, after making numerous short films, he directed his first feature film,
based on one of his homonymous short films “The Last Gateway” His second film as a director was the
multi-award winning “Malditos Sean!”, Co-directed with Fabián Forte. Then he made a series of short
films that include “El Mate Amargo” chosen like one of the 3 best Argentine shorts of the year 2012 a
black fantastic comedy. His third feature film: “You do not know who you’re talking to” is a black comedy
that parodies fantastic films that are still unedited in cinemas. Terrified is his latest film, a return to the

2018,edition,"Edito, Edito 2018",,Edito 2018,,,,,"The BIFFF stands for 36 years of passion, self-denial, sweat,
and sometimes blood. Hundreds of hours that make you
feel like your eyes will give in or that make you want to
light a candle.
Since 1983, the BIFFF has been a fierce defender of genre
movies, a section of the cinema that is now the most popular
in the world. Thanks to its co-productions and talented
technicians, Belgium is increasingly asserting itself as a key
player in cinematic fantasty art.
This year, we are proud to present eleven Belgian films, six
of which are world premieres! Internationally, Belgium is
holding a set of winning co-production cards: Muse (Jaume
Balagueró), I Kill Giants (co-produced by Chris Colombus
of Harry Potter fame), Mandy (with Nicolas Cage), and The
Man Who Killed Don Quixote (Terry Gilliam). Quite something,
isn’t it?
All this justifies, more than ever, the BIFFF’s risky bet to
create the first European genre film market in 2017. For
its second edition, the BIF Market is again welcoming
sellers and buyers from all over the world. We will also
be launching the “Work in Progress” section and offer a
perfect forum for Belgian professionals to showcase their
talents in an international context.
But above all, the BIFFF remains a popular festival, made
for and by the public. Of all Belgian film festivals, we have
the highest percentage of paying spectators. Our reputation
exceeds national boundaries, which becomes evident
from the number of submissions (nearly 2,000 films!) from
the four corners of the globe. This year, we’re having a record
number of twelve world premieres, thirteen international
premieres, and nine European premieres. Thirty-five
debut films will be programmed alongside work by top
names such as Ryuhei Kitamura, John Cameron Mitchell,
Paco Plaza, Lloyd Kaufman, Xavier Gens, Kiyoshi Kurosawa,
and Kim Ki-duk.
Genre cinema, as an uncompromising mirror of our time,
addresses topical themes: from feminism via the rise of nationalism
to migration. Our selection is clearly an indication
of current moral and ideological tendencies.
But rest assured: zombies, ghouls, vampires, monsters
unknown to Merriam-Webster, time loops, zany, daring,
and hardcore movies are still part and parcel of the festival’s
DNA!
As to novelties, it’s a real feast: an Augmented Reality exhibition
(unique in Belgium), a full-fledged Virtual Reality
section, our Vampire Ball (for the first time at BOZAR), a
monstrous Gaming Madness Zone, and a self-evident
collaboration: the second edition of the Boulevard du
Polar Festival. This will take place on April 13th and 14th
at BOZAR, with illustrious literary guests such as Craig
Johnson and Deon Meyer.
Speaking of guests, hundreds of actors and directors will
once again be present at the BIFFF to celebrate genre cinema.
Among them, we welcome Julia Ducournau, Stéphanie
Crayencour, and Laurent Lucas to our international jury,
which will be chaired this year by Lloyd Kaufman. Ah yes,
one last thing: a promising young Mexican director will
also appear at the BIFFF. He has just won four Oscars with
The Shape of Water, including Best Film and Best Director.
It’s a certain Guillermo del Toro... who will graciously be
giving an exceptional master class, co-hosted by Fabrice
du Welz and Jonas Govaerts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fight the mutants and, above all, try and survive!
Each team will consist of four players, with a value of 3 to 6. In
each round, they will have to decide on one of the following
actions:
Bring a player into the zoo (the team then gets the points of
the animal whose case they conquer but beware: there might
be a mutant hiding in there);
Move a character inside the zoo (idem);
Attack another character (this one then removes his chasuble
and gives it to the attacking team: one can attack only a character
whose value is less than or equal to one’s own value).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

deposition by Boulevard du Polar!
Minutes of the trial
Preliminary hearing: South African suspect Deon
Meyer (Monday, April 9th). Deon Meyer is the internationally
acclaimed author of seventeen best-sellers and also a director. He
will present his latest film and will participate in a master class.
Profile
Boulevard du Polar is an international multimedia
festival. Its motive is to pay tribute to a genre that
makes people’s hearts race and stirs up their neurons.
One book out of five is a mystery. The genre has continued to grow
in popularity and notoriety. The culprits are talented artists; it’s
not clear whether they are novelists, filmmakers, screenwriters or
illustrators. Literature and cinema revel in these stories rooted in
the real world and that hold up an unflattering mirror. Mysteries
(novels, comic books, and films noirs) rely on the careful observation
of society and report their findings in a critical and even controversial
manner. They delve into our behavior, our instincts, our weaknesses,
and our souls. In its slipstream were born modern knights and evil
geniuses, like all mortals full of humanity, compassion, and frailty.
The Suspects
The investigators are looking into a French connection. The sponsors’
identity is known. They are the repeat offenders Nadine Monfils and
Patrick Raynal. The list of suspected accomplices illustrates the scope
of the network, with various profiles: screenwriters, novelists, and
cartoonists with ink spots on their hands and film strips in their
clutches! They are Belgian and maintain tight relations with their
counterparts in mostly France.
The following persons have confessed: Ian Manook: author of a
Mongolian thriller trilogy, including the award-winning Yeruldelgger.
Serguei Dounovetz: continues the Nestor Burma series and
also wrote a novel about a mourning aging rocker behind the wheel
of a hearse in infernal Texas. Stanislas Petrosky: is it any wonder
that this former embalmer and fan of Frédéric Dard succeeded
in getting Nadine Monfils to write a preface for his humorous and
mocking stories?
The underworld’s women (also known as femmes fatales) are
inevitably guilty. The conspiracy includes:
Barbara Abel, Line Alexandre, Armelle Carbonel, Sophie
Chabanel, Laurence Fontaine, Pascale Fonteneau, Kate
Milie, Elsa Roch. Suspicions also weigh heavily on a probable
international network:
Craig Johnson (USA): will be summoned to shed light on Walt
Longmire’s tenth adventure (master class: Saturday, April 14th
at 4 PM).
Juan-Carlos Méndez Guédez (Venezuela): the man who
considers life to be a lucha libre-style fight will also be brought in.

Cities and Citizenship in Fantasy and Science Fiction
A few months before the municipal elections, the Human Rights League (HRL)
is organizing a master class about the image of the city in genre, fantasy, and
science-fiction cinema. The debate will take place after the film Survival Family
(Shinobu Yaguchi).
Many films tell the story of the city, and by extension of society and the world at large. Many filmmakers
have projected the aspirations and anxieties of their time onto metaphorical cities: Metropolis, Elysium,
Dark City, Sin City, Escape from New York... But here is quite a gap between the utopian Tomorrowland
(a harmonious, rational, and cold city) and the dystopian Gotham (corrupt, anarchic yet so vivid).
What happens when, as in Survival Family, a city (and society as a whole) stops working after a general
blackout? Can the rule of law survive? How about democracy? And what happens outside the city walls?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My research focuses on the representation

Antiquity as well as of later periods.
Homer uses the terms “thumos”, “psukhé”,
and “aion” to describe what animates man,
what pushes him to act, what makes him
live. These notions, quite abstract for us,
were for the ancient Greeks concrete physiological
substances. “Thumos” is the spirit,
the ordinary consciousness of man. It’s a
breath: vaporous, linked to the heart and
lungs. The head is the seat of the “psukhé”:
the soul or principle of life which, according
to the Greeks, is not limited to the brain
but extends to all the clear substances of
the body: marrow, fat... The “aion”, on the
other hand, is the paragon of all fluids: tears, sweat... In this sense,
the “aion” is a sign of life, opposed to dryness, a sign of aging
and death. I seek to implement this interiority of man, already
thought of as a material conjunction by the Greeks, through matter.
I endeavor to transpose the assimilation of moods, feelings,
and human psychology with substances and organs to the soil. I
try and find the structures and rhythms that spontaneously express
the essence of man. How can we externalize physical and
psychological beings through matter only? My work questions this
representation of the body through the implementation of various
techniques pertaining to today’s array of plastic possibilities. Made
with paint, paper, and especially ceramic sculpture, my figurative
work is plastic first and foremost. This double dimension of the
image of the body inscribed in earth matter signifies a correspondence
between man and his representation. Whether they are
deaf or imperious, the same impulses animate the represented
body and the ceramics that constitute it. This way, matter takes
on meaning and the human form expressive force.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
