it. The spaceship Icarus is launched to revive the star, but the mission fails and
ship and crew perish without a trace. Seven years later, humanity’s last hope leaves
Earth. The Icarus II carries a crew of eight men and women. They have a nuclear device
onboard which will breathe new life into the heart of the Sun. But deep into their voyage,
out of radio contact with Earth, their mission is starting to unravel. They receive a
distress call which is identified as coming from the Icarus I. Soon the crew are not only
fighting for their lives, but also for their sanity.
Sunshine once again pairs director Danny Boyle with screenwriter Alex Garland and
Producer Andrew MacDonald, the team behind our opening film of 2002, 28 Days Later.

and troubled. When he punches his Spanish teacher in class, Kale is placed under
house arrest. His mother, Julie, works night and day to support herself and her son, only
to be met with indifference and lethargy. The walls of his house begin to close in on Kale.
He becomes a voyeur as his interests turn outside the windows of his suburban home
towards those of his neighbours, one of which Kale begins to suspect is a serial killer.
But, are his suspicions merely the product of cabin fever and his overactive imagination?
Disturbia pays homage to Alfred Hitchcock, taking from Rear Window and Psycho as well
as using a few of the Grandmaster’s trademarks, getting you caught up in the action and
intrigue in no time. The suspense is sometimes unbearable, delivering a healthy dose
of good, old fashioned tension and trepidation. David Morse ( The Indian Runner, Twelve
Monkeys, The Green Mile ) is a wonderful villain to counter Shia LaBeouf’s ( I, Robot,
Constantine ) clueless hero. Carry-Anne Moss ( The Matrix trilogy, Memento ) juggles
work and family as Julie. If you’re looking for a good, solid thriller, Disturbia is highly
recommended."

era and trying to ensure their survival, the Mushi cast their malevolent
spell on humans and nature alike. Supernaturally connected to the basic essence of
life and death, they are capable of inhabiting the body and soul’s deepest recesses and
can only be detected by a Mushi master. The precociously white-haired Ginko has lost
his youth and one eye studying the Mushi. Like a travelling doctor, he visits far away
places to undo their deeds and to cure their victims. Meanwhile, in a secluded mansion,
beautiful Tanyu records the history of the creatures. But one day, the ink she uses to
write her tales permeates her blood vessels and all the characters disappear from her
precious scrolls. She has been infected by the Mushi and the time has come for Ginko to
save her life and to restore the lost archives of a fading world.
Mushishi is the latest cinematic wonder from Katsuhiro Otomo. This is the second venture
into live-action filmmaking and is based on the acclaimed manga by Yuki Urushibara. The
film is shot in beautiful remote locations and transports the audience to a world sealed within
isolated valleys and crowned by inaccessible mountains, a space that is both physically and
psychologically enchanted. The Mushi, the creatures at the centre of the story, are rendered
onscreen with so disturbing a presence that they seem to penetrate each of the viewer’s
five senses with their disquieting aura. An ode to the wonders and magic of nature, Mushishi
resonates with eerie mystery. It is an ancient myth for modern eyes."

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a true little anime gem. With character designs
by Yoshiyuki Sarasota ( Neon Genesis Evangelion ) and animation by the Madhouse

to look at, with lively and interesting backgrounds, lush colours and detailed animation.
Director Mamoru Hosada effectively conveys a true sense of emotion in the important
events and scenes, making sure that his film has more impact than any overblown epic
about giant robots or evil sorcerers."

From that moment on, Rick’s body undergoes an amazing transformation. Whenever he
gets an erection, he automatically changes into a vampire. As the cop is on a murder

been bribed by the villain. To make matters even worse, the fiend tries to kill his best
friend and colleague and kidnaps his girlfriend. And the only person who can help him, a
priest called Father Viau, will kill him when his transformation is complete and Ricky will
become a fully fledged vampire.
Vampire Cop Ricky is an action packed vampire comedy from Korea that will draw both

seriously, mixing together a dizzying range of genres from police thriller, horror and sex

never allowing you to stop and consider just how improbable it all is. With Soo-roh Kim

pictures of Tarik that are being sent from his own e-mail address ? The three friends

suicides are happening all over the world. Could there be a connection ?
If you think that D@bbe looks strangely familiar to Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s Kairo, then
you’re not mistaken. Director Hasan Karacadag has used many ideas from the J-Horror
masterpiece for his creepy and atmospheric supernatural shocker. But his main source
of inspiration is Dabbe-ul Harz, a demonic entity who is mentioned in the Koran as the
herald of the Apocalypse. Once the demon comes into the mortal world, his influence
starts to spread like a spider web. Despite the obvious budgetary restraints, Karacadag
manages to scare us slowly but surely, thanks to a solid script, aggressive sound design

into nightmares, their nightmares turn into hallucinations, and their hallucinations turn
into reality until the line between real and surreal exists no more. The valley begins to
resemble a mother’s womb and the caves are starting to look like the umbilical cord
between the mother and her unborn child. The memories of torture give way to an everhaunting
presence of guilt and regret that could only be felt by a mother.
While fantasy fans are keeping their eyes focused on the far East, our Turkish neighbours
have been releasing one genre film after another. Even though its domestic production is
flourishing, the movies have only now started to cross the border. Of the recent harvest,
Gomeda is undoubtedly one of the most interesting examples. During the first part,
Tan Tolga Demirci’s feature film debut takes on the allure of a slasher movie, but in the

Couple the pace of CSI with the intricate plot of The Butterfly Effect and the horror of

director Mustafa Altioklar. On the one hand, it’s an intertwined serial killer puzzle, on the

film is without a doubt the tour-de-force performance of Demet Evgar as a woman with
multiple personalities. A beautiful, innocent, terrifying and disgusting character are all
merged in one woman. Great cinematography, coupled with extensive camerawork and

Black Sheep is a riotous mix of splatter-movie aesthetics, national dread and ecological
warning. Jonathan King’s debut feature is also a very funny horror film that makes you
think of Peter Jackson’s early work, especially Braindead. What makes the movie tick
is the juxtaposing of pastoral New Zealand landscapes against the perverse imagery
of rabid, genetically deformed sheep ravishing the locals. The gut-wrenching mutant

they think is a sick and dying man. They have no way of knowing what a dangerous man
the Greek is. There will be blood in the water by the time he’s finished, but will he escape
death again at the expense of the lives of everyone onboard ? Or will the Ferryman play
another game with everyone’s lives ?
From New Zealand comes a truly scary horror film, with a unique and original script and an
acclaimed international cast, headed by John Rhys-Davies ( Indiana Jones, The Lord of the
Rings ) as the Greek and Kerry Fox ( An Angel At My Table, Shallow Grave ), Craig Hall ( King
Kong, Perfect Creature ) and Lawrence Makoare ( Die Another Day, Lord of the Rings ) as his
unsuspecting victims. Director Chris Graham follows in the footsteps of the classic horrors
from the past such as The Shining and Dead Calm. You will love and hate its characters and
their classic one liners just before they are struck down by evil. The Ferryman will take you
on a journey dark enough to satisfy even the most hardcore horror fan."

angry at her uncle, Nam-il, her guardian, for showing up at her school shamelessly drunk.
Ignoring his father’s excuses for Nam-il, she’s soon engrossed in her aunt Nam-joo’s archery
tournament on TV. Meanwhile, outside the snack bar, people are fascinated by an unidentified
object hanging onto a bridge. In an instant, the object reveals itself as a terrifying creature
turning the riverbank into a gruesome sea of blood. Amid the chaos, Hyun-seo is snatched up
by the creature right before her father’s eyes. Gyang-du and his family take up arms and try to
rescue their beloved Hyun-seo from the clutches of the monster.
From Joon-ho Bong, the director of Memories of Murder, comes the best monster movie
in decades. The Host is a superbly entertaining fusion of creature feature thrills and
genuine heartfelt human drama. By focusing on a family in crisis and adding a hefty
dose of pointed social and political satire, The Host rises far above its enthusiastically
embraced B-movie roots. Excellent effects and design work and a moving performances
from Kang-ho Song (Memories of Murder, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) as Gang-du,
complete the picture. The Host is both scary and tragic and will have you jumping with

of a North Dakota farm. Amidst the tranquil sway of the farm’s field of sunflowers,
16-year old Jess soon realises how terrifying seclusion can be when she and her 3-year
old brother Ben begin to see ominous apparitions invisible to anyone else. When those
spectres become violent, Jess’ sanity is questioned; a double jeopardy for the tormented
teen. Her troublesome past comes face to face with the past of those that once lived in
the house, a perilous confrontation that leaves her believability in question with those
she desperately tries to warn before it’s too late.
The English language debut of the gifted horror specialists Oxide and Danny Pang is a
visually assured and moody ghost story with echoes to Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining.
The Pangs are masters of confined space, and they conjure up unsettling, jolting
examples of entrapment and collapse that reaches its sharpest expression inside the
home’s mysterious, dank cellar. The film-makers tap into a dark, almost forbidding
sense of nightmare and violation through their eerie camera movement and rapid
cutting. Starring Dylan McDermott ( TV’s The Practice, In The Line Of Fire ), Penelope Ann

same: the victims wildly stab themselves to death, cut their own throats and butcher
themselves beyond recognition, without any apparent reason. The only thing the dead
have in common is the phone number they call just before they perish at their own hand.
Keiko, a crack policewoman, takes it upon herself to solve the case. Soon enough she
reaches the conclusion that someone is entering the victims’ dreams and persuading
them to take their own lives. She appeals to Kyoichi, a man known as a nightmare
detective who can enter the dreams of others, to help. When Wakimaya, one of Keiko’s
colleagues, falls victim to the killer, Keiko takes the risk and dials the number, though she
knows that she may well be the next suicide on the list.
In his own, inimitable style, Shinya Tsukamoto will once again delight the Bifff audience
with this brutal, violent and nerve-racking horror slasher. Tsukamoto plays on the
old adage that there is nothing more unpleasant to gaze upon than other people’s
dreams, as well as the theme that, deep down, everyone has a powerful urge to exit
their disappointing temporary life for the eternity of death. Nightmare detective Kyoichi
Kagenuma is played by up and coming actor Ryuhei Matsuda, the star of Takashi Miike’s
Big Bang Love Juvenile A. Heroine Keiko Kirishima, a woman pushed to the brink of

Reluctant at first, Ye himself is haunted by guilt, not knowing how to let go of his dying

Silk is one of the best ghost movies in recent years, presenting an intriguing and
complex mix of sci-fi, actual science and heart-moving characters of flesh and blood.
At its core, Silk dwells on themes of existence, family, and the human emotions of love

1, 2, 3 Whiteout plays an original game with how we think about science and future and
refers with equally playful ease to portrayals of the future old and new. Partly thanks
to the unusual format of 16mm for a feature and the retro-setting, the film looks as if it
were made in the 1960s or 1970s. It does not only present a mixture of past and future in
its form, the story itself also seems to want to escape time. Alongside feature fragments,
1, 2, 3, Whiteout also comprises various kinds of vignettes and archive footage. Director
James June Schneider collected images himself at various places in the world over a
number of years, from the Gobi desert to New York’s Times Square. The use of music
is equally unusual and contributes to the intriguing and alienating mood of the film.

The 4th Dimension examines the complex themes of dreams, the supernatural and

policy aimed at securing the nation’s survival. They target citizens who have received
more from society than what they have contributed. You have committed social fraud
or tax evasion. You’re a drug addict or an alcoholic. You can’t take care of your own
children. You put an excessive strain on the health system. You’re unemployed for an
unusually long time. You live on the edge of the law. In short, you’re an unproductive
member of society, a burden to the system. Unless you can prove you’ve contributed to
any kind of unselfish activity for the benefit of the common good, you’ll be rounded up by
the army and you’ll be exterminated.
How To Get Rid Of The Others might be first class political satire, it’s also frightfully
close to reality. The movie is just the logical consequence of a certain current political
discourse aimed at demonising everyone from cigarette smokers, immigrants, the
poor, the sick, the unemployed and the old to political radicals. Director Anders Ronnow
Klarlund also didn’t have to look far for inspiration, as Denmark has already been ruled

He’s rescued by the people of a small town steel mill. Soon, terrible incidents begin

Kei Fujiwara does not only star in ID, she also serves as screenwriter, production
designer, cinematographer and editor. Her second film is even more disturbing than her
debut, Organ, from 1996. The instinctive drive and unconscious desire is the basis of
what consists our self, our ego, our id. Fujiwara’s cosmic view of these hidden desires,
of life and death is sublime to the point of grotesque and is eccentrically and humorously

From the legendary Czech filmmaker and animator Jan Svankmajer comes a truly

is deeply troubling and at the same time compelling. His latest film Lunacy combines
live action with strange animation sequences, full of cavorting raw meat, pig’s trotters,
eyeballs and tongues skittering along surfaces and asks who is truly mad and who is
truly free. Edgar Allan Poe’s tale The Premature Burial serves as the key plot device, with
Svankmajer using it to explore Marquis De Sade’s questioning of good and evil. Fans

suggests he films everything, a piece of advice that Bro takes far too literally. His constant
filming succeeds in driving both his friends and wife nuts and Lene ends up moving to a

Movies are the best way to experiment with the limits of reality. This is proven in
Christoffer Boe’s third feature Offscreen. Not being afraid to experiment and to take
risks, he turns away from the distinctive visuals of his first two films, Reconstruction and
Allegro, and opts for a scruffy, ultra-realist look. Nicolas Bro ( The Green Butchers, Allegro,
Adam’s Apples ) reigns supreme as himself. As lead actor and cinematographer, his

captor, a cruel survivalist woodsman, informs her she can die there or cut herself loose
with a razor, which will require an excruciating act of self-mutilation. Motivated by her
desperate need to find out what happened to her 6-year old daughter, Hope manages to
free herself only to become the man’s slave. Gradually the balance between captor and
slave begins to shift. Hope’s actions lead to a devastating conclusion and a secret so
dark that it threatens to destroy Hope entirely.
If you though movies like Wolf Creek and Saw were unbearable to watch, wait until you
see Broken, an small independent production from England that takes the survival horror
genre to an entire new level. Co-directors Simon Brand and Adam Mason show us the
gruesome ordeal through the eyes of the victim, a superb performance of co-producer
Nadja Brand ( The 13th Sign ) as an ordinary woman who finds herself in an situation so
extreme and cruel beyond belief. The cinematography is beautiful and the atmospheric

whose touch alone could be lethal. The infected are called “ strangers ” and they wander

Their presence can only be detected because they make the temperature fall below zero

The Cold Hour is not only a horror film, it is also an exercise in style. One location
and a dedicated team of actors are all that is used to disturb, frighten and entertain
the audience. This means that terror will come from suggestion and our emotional

Jade Warrior is the first Finnish martial arts movie. Its young director Antti-Jussi Annila
wanted to honor both his own heritage and the conventions of Chinese wuxia film and he
has succeeded brilliantly. Jade Warrior is a gorgeous film to look at, beautifully designed
and detailed and shot in a series of dramatic locations. Tragic romance and supernatural
fight scenes compete for our attention. The script is a lyrical piece of work, skilfully
combining and linking Finnish and Chinese ancient culture. The cast is well chosen

uses of everyday objects, including toilets, chickens and felt-tipped pens, and drops them
in the cage to see what the humans will do with them. Meanwhile on Earth, the respective
spouses of subject A and B, Donatien and Ursuline, meet and soon start an uneasy
cohabitation, which is of course observed in all its messy confusion, by the curious aliens.
Nos Amis les Terriens is a unique genre-bending exercise that juggles serious sci-fi
with observational comedy. The feature film debut of French writer Bernard Werber
is presented like a nature documentary, the movie is narrated by veteran actor Pierre
Arditi ( Same Old Song, Smoking/No Smoking ) who is attempting to explain humans and
what makes us tick to his fellow aliens. Our species is observed from birth to death with
hidden cameras and wildly speculative and comic guesses are made about our habits.

sermon against the xenophobia and hatred for people that are different that plagues
contemporary society. Those who have tried to raise humanity to a higher spiritual level,

End of the Line, by Montreal director Maurice Deveraux, will make you think twice about

gut wrenching, nastily clever feature is an original take on the survival horror genre.
It plays on modern paranoia, showing religious extremism through the lens of slasher

creative sfx that enhance the film’s small budget. Reminiscent of the early works of such

innocent. Four hundred years later, Ryan James, a streetwise drug dealer, has escaped from

Porhowski, a strong-willed and dedicated detective, sceptically tries to separate fact from

the case, a greater truth unravels, drawing attention to those writings from centuries ago. In
an effort to save lives, Porhowski soon finds that the life at stake is her own.
On the surface, The Entrance is a supernatural thriller about good versus evil, but beneath
this, the harrowing second feature of Canadian writer-director Damon Vignale questions
our basic notions of faith and morality. Is it true that no sin goes unpunished ? Can we
ever escape our past, no matter what we have done with our lives ? And, most crucially,
do demons exist apart from what we conjure up from our own subconscious minds ? The
Entrance is unrelenting and psychologically more and more wrenching as it unfolds to
its thought-provoking ending. Sarah-Jane Redmond (Tv’s Millennium and Smallville, The

only the sinister presence in her apartment, but also the bizarre obsession of Tulip, her

Espectro is above all an intense psychological thriller that plunges its heroine and the

Jimmy. However, a stranger in Jimmy’s truck, claiming to be his friend, picks her up. He
turns out to be a psychotic killer. Just when Claire thinks she has managed to escape
him, he finds her and brutally and viciously murders her. The next day Claire wakes up
and everything seems normal. Perhaps it was all a bad dream. Then it happens again.
And again. Claire soon realizes she’s trapped in an endless nightmare where she’s forced
to relive her own gruesome murder over and over again. To break this circle, she needs
to piece together the truth, a truth too surprising and horrible to imagine.
Groundhog Day meets Hostel in Gruesome, a bad acid trip in hell from directing team
Joshua and Jeffrey Crook. Gruesome plays with the genres of psychological thriller
and horror. As a thriller, Claire’s harrowing quest for an answer to her riddle, a superb
performance from Lauren Currie Lewis ( One Per Cent, Broken Strings ), intensifies as the
attacks on her life grow increasingly more brutal. The horror comes from the bloodiness
and brutality of her ordeal, the grisly nature of her visions and the creeping feeling that the
end to all this cannot be a happy one. Gruesome, a horrifying new kind of nightmare and a
big festival hit worldwide, will almost certainly also nail the Bifff audience to their seats."

In the annals of modern fear, few films have had as deep an impact as Wes Craven’s

demanding more, film legend Wes Craven teamed up with his son Jonathan to write the
script for The Hills Have Eyes 2. The film is directed by cutting-edge filmmaker Martin
Weisz, whose resent film Grimm Love has both won acclaim and stirred up controversy
for its graphic depiction of modern day cannibalism. The combined talents of Wes Craven

murder when you’re the victim ? Nick’s only chance is to find his attacker, Annie, before
his body expires. But the troubled teen, neglected after the death of her mother, is on the

The Invisible is the American remake of the Swedish film of the same name by Joël
Bergvall and Simon Sandquist ( which we presented at the Bifff in 2003 ). Produced by
the team behind The Sixth Sense and directed by genre-specialist writer-director David

original. Goyer infuses The Invisible with the same qualities that are the trademarks of
his screenplays : using the fantastic genre to deepen the psychology of its hero, a strong
performance by Justin Chatwin ( Taking Lives, War of the Worlds ) and focusing more on
emotion than on effects. If only all remakes were like this."

Re-Cycle is easily the strongest film of directing brothers Danny and Oxide Pang since
their breakthrough hit The Eye. They’ve created a persuasively dark Alice Through The
Looking Glass parallel universe with shades of Terry Gilliam, Spirited Away and What
Dreams May Come. Besides Angelica Lee ( The Eye ), who plays Chu Xun, the star of
the film is undoubtedly an entirely cgi rendered Hong Kong in ruins. It‘s an apocalyptic,
decaying world, populated by suicides, rusting toys, ignored ancestors, and aborted

D-Day is a horror film which doesn’t really need ghosts. Director Eun-kyung Kim decided
to structure her film around drama rather than gore or technique. The film’s emotional
kick emerges from its claustrophobic setting, and the young actresses keep us glued

The Unknown is a dramatic and emotional thriller with Hitchcockian overtones from
Giuseppe Tornatore, the director of the Oscar-winning Cinema Paradiso. As a thriller, it
presses all the right buttons, delving deep into the dark, obsessive side of the human
psyche and greatly benefiting from a lush orchestral soundtrack that must stand as
one of the highlights of composer Ennio Morricone ( Once Upon A Time In The West, The
Mission, The Untouchables). The denouement, when it comes, is as stark as Vertigo

(Nin x Nin: Ninja Hattori-kun, the Movie, Summer of Ubume) pulls off an engaging
performance as Shaodea. Veteran actor Ren Osugi (Sonatine, Loft, Nightmare Detective)
plays her father. And Bo-lin Chen (The Huadu Chronicles : Blade of the Rose, A Chinese
Tall Story, Silk) shows off his martial arts skills as Haishon."
2007,movie ,,,THE UNGODLY,Thomas Dunn,2006,"USA,Spain",,,"Wes Bentley, Mark Borkowski, Joanne Baron, Marina
Gatell, Albert Lopez Murtra, Kenny Johnson, Beth Grant",,,,,,,99',"Thriller, Horror, Crime",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0489318,?ref_=fn_al_tt_1",,,,,"What’s really handy about the current documentary craze, is that you don’t need a lot
of money or talent to make a successful movie. You just need a camera, know how
to hold it and especially, to have a truly risky subject that will make your spectators guts
twist and turn. When it comes to this, Mickey has a winner on his hands. By accident
he catches notorious Philadelphia serial killer Lemac on tape. Thanks to his footage
of the murder, he manages to blackmail Lemac and convince him to participate in a
documentary about his grisly deeds. The only problem is that Lemac really takes his
time and Mickey is forced to speed things up a bit and manipulate the murders to get the
shocking images he craves.
It’s not that because we’re Belgian, that we don’t have the right to be chauvinistic once
in a while. The Ungodly clearly draws its inspiration from our very own Man Bites Dog.
That said, Thomas Dunn’s first feature is no copy but an original take on the serial killer
phenomenon. It focuses on the psychological evolution of the characters, especially
Mickey, a superb performance by Wes Bentley ( American Beauty, Ghost Rider ). His
subject Lemac is a disturbing part by Mark Borkowski, who also wrote the screenplay.
The Ungodly is an insidious and psychological thriller that infuses its audience with an
almost existential fear."

Steel : Sekiguchi is a young car mechanic leading an unexciting life. That all
changes when one day his boss asks him to take his attractive sister on a drive. To
Sekiguchi‘s surprise, his hot date is covered from head to waist by a sack.
The Inheritance : Divorcee Saeko decides to leave the city with her 7-year old son
Michio to live with her bedridden mother. One day, Michio sees his mother staring
at a wooden chest in a shed. From then on, Saeko’s behaviour becomes more and more
strange.
U nholy Women is an omnibus film: three stories by three directors. Each tells the horrific
tale of a woman who is caught by desire or obsession and becomes a monster or ghost
that attacks their loved ones. Keita Amemiya, director of Rattle Rattle, has managed to
do something rare; make a ghost movie that’s truly frightening and shocking. The surreal
weirdness of Steel, by Takuji Suziki, will remind you of the best of Shinya Tsukamoto. And
Keisuki Toyoshima atmospheric ghost story The inheritance was supervised by horror
master Takashi “The Grudge” Shimizu."
2007,movie ,,,THE UNSEEABLE,Wisit Sasanatieng,2006,Thailand,European,,"Supornthip Choungrangsee, Siraphun Wattanajinda",,,,,,,97',"Romance, Horror,, Mystery",,,"https:,,www.imdb.com,title,tt0950500,?ref_=fn_al_tt_1",PEN CHOO KUB PEE,,,,"Thailand, 1934. Nuanjan, a young pregnant woman from upcountry, travels to Bangkok
in search of her husband, Chob, who went missing there for almost a year. She ends
up seeking temporary residence in a rambling, rundown mansion. It’s a scary place, with
creaking wooden floors, squeaking doors, locked rooms and an overgrown garden. The
house happens to hold many secrets. Most of those concern its owner, Mrs. Ranjuan,
a widowed aristocrat who is as different from Nuanjan as black and white, in terms of
social status, skin colour and manners. Tension rises between the two when Nuanjan
gives birth to her baby and Mrs. Ranjuan requests to spend time with the infant every
day. The lady of the house was never able to have children, but now she’ll have a child to
show to her husband, even though he died many years ago.
Wisit Sasanatieng’s films have often been described as unconventional, satirical and
larger than life. In his latest film, The Unseeable, the director of Tears of the Black
Tiger and Citizen Dog pays tribute to early Thai ghost movies. It’s an intelligent and
straightforward horror film that shows the coexistence of the living and the dead.
The Unseeable frightens the audience with a haunting musical score, creepy shadow
movements, camera angles that suggest the heroine is always being watched and a
meticulous production design that evokes the sense of a desolate Bangkok of decades
ago."

you on a fantastic voyage in space ! Have you ever
dreamt of far away landscapes inhabited by strange

During this two day festival full of films and workshops,
children will think they’re on another planet. Classics,
shorts, animated films … all we can say is that they’ll all
be fantastic!
As usual, we will screen some films made by children
during workshops.
And for those who can’t stay in their seats, we’ll offer
more than they can handle: extra-terrestrial puppet
workshops, a cooking workshop baking “space
cakes”, or even another workshop to build intergalactic
spaceships and astronaut’s outfits to prepare your first
leap into space.

Have decades of watching fantastic films let

Have we become completely disoriented by all

Have all those superhero stories given us

Do we believe in fairy tales ?
Fact is that when it comes to this
25th anniversary edition of the Festival,
THE SKY IS THE LIMIT!
300 extra seats ( less sold outs ? ), fewer days
but still as many films, concerts &
Dj-sets every night, and 4 times more space :
for the audience, the professionals,
the exhibitions and the animations.
It looks like a tabula rasa where we
reconstruct everything from the ground up !
You should wonder if these last 24 years
where just a sort of general rehearsal for what
is about to take place now.
Don’t worry, we’re not suffering
from megalomania.
The audience remains at the heart of all
things : the prices continue to be affordable,
there are many free activities ( markets,
conventions, animations, and, exceptionally,
the Body Painting Contest ) and a shuttle
service will transport spectators from and to
the city centre, public transportation hubs and
Tour & Taxis.
The Festival and the Vampire Ball take place
under one roof, there’s a restaurant,
snack bar, bars, a cloak room and many
stands where you can celebrate
your love for the genre.

2007,edition,Poster,,Poster 2007,"Dany,",,,,"Best known for the ‘Olivier Rameau’
series and the several soft-erotic ‘Blagues
Coquines’. After getting his degree in Fine
Arts, he did his first comics work as the
assistant of Mittéï. However, Dany has to
end this collaboration because of his military
service. During this period, he found the time
to do several short stories for Tintin magazine.
Demobilized, he joined Michel Greg’s art studios
in Brussels, where he worked on among others
‘Les As’. In 1968, Dany and writer Greg created
the ‘Olivier Rameau’ series for Tintin, a poetic and
humerous series that was Dany’s first solo success.
His first foray in realistic comics was his 1975 collaboration with
Jean Van Hamme: ‘Histoire
sans Héros’. With the
same writer he produced
the burlesque ‘Harlequin’
series, before he took over
the artwork of ‘Bernard
Prince’ from Hermann in
1978. From the 1980s
on, Dany focused on
“naughty” comics, drawing
his first soft-erotic stories
for Glénat’s Le Canard
Sauvagge magazine. Dany’s
breakthrough in soft-erotic
comics was however ‘Ça
Vous Intéresse?’, that
appeared in 1990. The
following years, several
other albums containing
these ‘Blagues Coquines’
appeared. In 1992, Dany
launched a new adventure
series about Central Africa,
‘Equator’.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Belgian fantastic film production. That’s the reason behind
the creation of the first Workshop in 1996. The ambition
of this initiative has remained unchanged throughout
the years: to offer the students of our film schools the
opportunity to gain experience by making three fantastic
short films under the supervision of an experienced
foreign film director. This year, Anders Rønnow-Klarlund
will reveal some of the secrets of his craft to a new
generation of film professionals. The talented Danish
director of “Possessed” (Golden Raven BIFFF 2000) and
“Strings” will this year also present his latest film “How To
Get Rid of the Others” to the festival public.
Collaborations with professional partners from the
audiovisual field are intended to generate real production
conditions within which the students of RITS and NARAFI
can realize three short fantastic films. Logistical support
facilities are provided by Maquillages S.A., Eye-lite, Key
Grip Systems S.A., APPLE, Double Precision, ABATAN SA,
while students of LE SITE (Enseignement Supérieur en
Infographie et Technique d’Expression) in Hornu, under
the guidance of SFX specialist Jean-Yves Arboit, are
taking care of the digital postproduction.
The 3 shorts will be shot from March 6 to 8 in and
around the “Caves de Cureghem”. The finished
results will be presented during the Belgian Film Day,
on Friday April 13, after which Eye Lite will provide
one student with a value of 2,500 € in lightning
material for his/her next film project. Thanks to the
collaboration of all partners and the support of the
Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie, the Workshop of the
BIFFF has become a valuable and important tool in the
education of our future film makers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your presence, your good spirits and your
youngness of heart and mind, you became

For always, you’ve conquered a place in the
hearts of genre fans and movie lovers from
all over the world. We’re convinced you’re
now looking at us from the heavenly balcony

You were honoured many times as a director

sublime Sons and Lovers and the epic Glory)

have created a representation of death with
their installation. The creative process was very
intimate. They found themselves facing a subject
and an act that questioned their notions of the
body, their convictions and personal experiences.
It has also been a collective effort. Each creation
is the fruit of dialogue and the exchange of
techniques (sculpting, patina’s, casting, creation of
textiles and materials …).
The result is a circle which you can now penetrate.
Two gates will invite you to pass through.
