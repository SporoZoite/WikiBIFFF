Where Anton is strong and tall and has perfect eyesight, Vincent is weak and sickly and wears glasses that give away his genetic inferiority. Where Anton earns his parents constant praise, encouragement and admiration, Vincent is coddled, pitied and kept home. But there is no gene for the human spirit, and Vincent finds that this is the key to changing his fate. When Vincent saves his perfect younger brother from drowning in the midst of a race, he realizes that strength doesn’t always come from the body. Meanwhile, the humiliated Anton remains silent about the whole affair, never acknowledging his brother’s triumph. Ready to revolt against his proscribed future, Vincent leaves home, more determined than ever to pursue his dream of traveling into space, of leaving earth and all its oppressive order and assumptions behind.
Gattaca is writer-director Andrew Niccol’s vision of the future perfect. He creates a world of stunning visual and behavioral order, a world in which the most volatile human qualities like passion and faith and emotion are passé and cool perfection is the height of fashion. And into this world he brings a character who refuses to go along with the system, who finds himself on a twisting and suspenseful journey to escape his own identity. Gattaca stars Ethan Hawke (Dead Poets Society, Before Sunrise) asVincent Freeman, the young man who’s determined to break out of his imperfect genetic destiny and see his dreams come true. Uma Thurman (Dangerous Liaisons, Pulp Fiction, Batman and Robin) stars as Irene, the girl he falls in love with."

Smart-mouthed Randy, her old pal who also survived the Woodsboro killers, is enrolled in Windsor’s film school. And he’s fine now, just like Sid. But the past never really goes away. In fact, it reaches out and kills someone on campus when a movie called “Stab” opens around the country. “Stab”, based on the best selling book by tabloid tease Gale Weathers, depicts the real life account of the Woodsboro killings.

He vows to track down the killers who gunned down his partner and bring them to justice. While investigating a seemingly unrelated murder, Laniel stumbles upon a tangled web of intrigue centered on a halfway house owned by Zachary Osborne, the victim. Nicknamed “Murderer’s Haven”, the sinister building houses killers on probation waiting to reenter society. Now rehabilitated, they are still ruled by their obsessions, their deviant impulses and their rage. Every one of those criminals had a motive for wanting Osborne dead. For example, Mercier; he knew Osborne had been fooling around with his wife. Or Tanguay, who would have loved to make him pay for the abuse Carole Osborne had to suffer at the hands of her cruel husband.

In a secret room on the floor above him, a powerful blood ritual sacrifice is being performed. The leader of the cult, a “turned” archbishop, pronounces the final magical incantation that conjures up a creature from the depths of Hell : the Shadowbuilder. Vassey, twin 9 mm Glocks at the ready, bursts into the room, but he has arrived a few moments too late. The black magic ritual is over. It has accomplished its purpose. Vassey fires his pistols at the zealots and manages to kill the former archbishop who dies with the self-satisfaction of seeing the evil entity they have invoked, escape into the world. When he later recounts these events to Bishop Gallo, the skeptical Vassey refuses to accept that what he witnessed is the beginning of a terrible evil. Gallo tells him that the “second ordeal of Invocation” will happen at the darkest moment of the coming solar eclipse.
Bram Stoker’s Shadowbuilder is a horror film for the millennium. While its roots stretch back into the classic and much-loved horror films of the ’30s and ’40s, it plays on our ultimate fears as we near the end of the second millennium A.D. In Shadowbuilder the classic forces of good and evil are roused when a black magic coven invokes a demon with the sole purpose of undoing creation. Jamie Dixon brings his enormous visual effects talent and experience to the role of director. Michael Rooker (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer) stars as outlaw priest Father Vassey. Andrew Jackson (Sirens) plays Shadowbuilder, a character built from a foul mixture of shadows and evil intentions."

Realizing that the carefully orchestrated effort to murder all of Hong Kong’s druglords is clearly the work of the 701 Squad, the heroic Tsui embarks on a perilous journey of self-discovery that pits him against the most virulent adversary imaginable. In order to protect his closest friends - Inspector Shi of the beleaguered Hong Kong police department and Tracy, an attractive fellow librarian - from retaliation at the hands of the ruthless 701 Squad, Tsui creates a dark mask to disguise his identity. As the Black Mask, he is transformed into a lethal weapon in the war to control the world’s drug trade.
Black Mask bursts off the screen with an exotic blend of high-tech weaponry, unmatched martial arts prowess, bodies, bombs and bondage. Directed by Daniel Lee, Black Mask is one of the most expensive films to be produced in Hong Kong. Lee reinvents the action genre in his slick, smartly imaginative, visually stylish and slyly humorous adventure on an epic scale. Tsui Hark (Double Team, Shangai Blues, A Chinese Ghost Story) is the producer of this sophisticated action movie."

Joe’s religious upbringing makes him hesitant at first, but Maxxx’s insistence and big money offers eventually pay off. On the set, Joe meets Ben, an inventor and scientist who plays his loyal sidekick, Choda-Boy. An MIT graduate, Ben’s fascination with porn is strictly carnal. His fortune was made as an inventor. Orgazmo becomes a huge blockbuster, bringing in millions world-wide. Joe is praised by critics and loved by audiences everywhere. Deemed the crossover hit of the decade, Orgazmo inspires dozens of ripoffs and becomes a cultural phenomenon. Just about this time, Joe finds out that Ben has actually invented a real-life working orgazmerator, a ray gun that stops criminals in their tracks by generating powerful orgasms.
Massively inventive and spiked with perversely wicked humor, Orgazmo is a delightful movie that showcases the multiple talents of Trey Parker, the writer-director-star. It doesn’t take a movie connoisseur to perceive that Orgazmo’s basic premise is influenced by the Rocky Horror Show. But Parker is shrewd enough to realize that his deliciously nasty humor should flow as directly as possible from the straight-faced acting of his characters: the good, the bad, the ugly and the eccentric (and there are plenty of each type)."

The business includes faking photographs so that dead soldiers seem reunited with their families.

Initially unimpressed, Castle soon convinces himself that the photograph is genuine.
Photography, as someone might have once said, is a pack of lies; and cinema is a pack of lies 24 times a second. That’s why we love the movies. We want to be in a world that allows us to believe that a man can fly, and perhaps even that fairies exist. No doubt that was part of the appeal of the faked photographs some 80 years ago.

Violent psychopath Victor Kelly, son of a Catholic father and a Protestant mother, is invited by Darkie Larche to join a gang of Loyalist killers. Together, they murder a randomly chosen Catholic victim. When the body is found, journalist Ryan writes up the story. Larche reports to ringleader McLure about Victor’s knack for random violence. Victor slits the throat of another victim at a bar where the gang meet. Ryan’s obsession with the killings mounts. Ryan visits his wife Elizabeth to apologise for beating her up while drunk, but she still leaves him. A kneecapping assignment on three burglars goes wrong when gang member Hacksaw shoots a victim and Victor has to finish the man off. McLure is gratified by Ryan’s coverage of killings which have turned Victor, now the leader of the “Resurrection Man”, into a feared local celebrity. Later, Victor is arrested and convicted, based on Hacksaw’s confession. In prison, Victor murders Hacksaw and is subsequently released. The killings continue.
Based on Eion McNamee’s extraordinary novel, “Resurrection Man” offers a cast of vivid, frightening characters. Marc Evans’ film confronts us with the masochistic pleasures of cinematic violence. James Nesbitt (Here My Song) stars as the soul-dead, wife-beating journalist Ryan. Stuart Townsend stars as the deranged killer Victor.

The women, referred to by their apartment numbers, each share common yet dissimilar obsessions: eating disorders and problematic relationships with men. 301 is an amateur cook whose spare time is spent preparing and eating lavish meals, while her bookish and reclusive neighbor 302 becomes ill at the mere sight or smell of food. In a series of flashbacks, we see how the relationship between the two women develops and learn the shocking secret of what happened to 302.
Director Chul-Soo Park started his film-career in 1976. His film 301-302 was the first Korean film ever to get a world-wide distribution. This small bugdet film explores in an inventive way the psychological disfunctioning of two women living in the same building. It’s about beauty complexes, diet failure, painful love affaires and women dealing with a man-oriented society. A shocking feminist thriller that will change forever the way you’re dealing with food."

Marshall, a local field researcher who has fallen short of his own expectations, is investigating the area’s sudden ecological devastation. Populations of small wildlife are rapidly disappearing and strange, gooey nests are springing up over the countryside. He watches a young woman arrive in town as it’s closing up for winter. Beautiful and street-wise, Amy is seeking refuge where no one will find her and where she can try to rediscover the person she once was. Hiding out in her parent’s old holiday cabin, now dirty and decaying, she realises Langdon is not how she remembered it as a child. It’s mid-winter and a vicious storm is brewing. Alone at night, Amy notices some bizarre occurences: she finds a weird nest in her generator shed and can hear scuttling noises in the rafters. There is something odd, something nasty which is not just eating her cake, but is seriously distressing her cat.
Aberration stars Simon Bossell (Spider and Rose, Hotel de Love) as Marshall, a clever but socally inept young scientist and Pamela Gidley (Liebestraum, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) as Amy, who has returned to her family’s remote mountain cabin to escape from her dark past.

In 1981, An American Werewolf in London (by John Landis) and The Howling (by Joe Dante) both took advantage of new special-effects technology. Using a canny mixture of horror, sly comedy and genuine emotional content, each revived the apparently played-out werewolf movie sub-genre. It’s taken 16 years for a sequel to John Landis’ hit. Anthony Waller (whose debut Mute Witness was also about horrors afflicting Americans abroad) reuses some of the new “rules” of lycanthropy Landis laid down, but also changed some basic werewolf ground rules. Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do) stars as Andy and Julie Delpy plays his girlfriend Sérafine."

With the assistance of a potion concocted by Simon’s wise Teddy Bear, the boy is magically reduced to microscopic size and bravely ventures into his grandfather’s body, determined to find the source of the old man’s pain.
From Academy Award nominated producer John M.

Not since Alice wandered through the looking glass has such an extraordinary and wondrous journey been undertaken.

The problem is that he can’t remember whether he committed the murders or not. In fact, most of his memories have completely vanished, and for one sickening moment he is convinced that he has gone stark raving mad. As Murdoch seeks to unravel the twisted riddle of his identity, he is drawn deeper and deeper into the murky city where he stumbles upon a fiendish underworld controlled by a group of ominous beings collectively known as The Strangers. These shadow-like figures possess the ability to stop the time and alter the city and its inhabitants - a bizarre, transmogrifying process known as Tuning. Through some evolutionary quirk, Murdoch is also imbued with this power and thus, he alone is able to resist The Stranger’s control over his mind. And for that, he must be destroyed.
Dark World is a noir-ish tale set in a ’30s-’40s-style “City That Never Was,” which features murder, mayhem, mind control and malevolent presences. The film is produced by Andrew Mason and directed by Alex Proyas - both having fulfilled those duties on the equally dark The Crow. The casting of Rufus Sewell (Carrington) and William Hurt (Michael, Smoke), as a man accused of a series of murders and the detective searching for him, rounds out the gray color scheme."

One evening, Angstel is waiting for Zelda in front of a movie theatre where Murnau’s Aurore is playing. She doesn’t show up. Angstel sees this as an act of betrayal. His last chance for love and salvation has gone up in smoke. Ancetta, a dancer at “Wasted”, runs into Angstel in the street.

Stone returns from the dead and launches a tense and bloody game of cat-and-mouse against Hawk and The Organisation which double-crossed him.
In the tradition of low budget successes like The Evil Dead, Bad Taste and El Mariachi, The Eliminator is Ireland’s first high-octane, non-stop action, low-budget spoof thriller. Made by and starring a group of remarkably enthusiastic complete unknowns, The Eliminator bears little resemblance to any other film ever made about Northern Ireland. 22-Year-old director Enda Hughes is a true movie addict who has been making short films on Super 8 for years.

In the dark of the theater, in that one magical moment, it is a very powerful thing to believe. But what happens when that belief is carried into the light of the real world? In the summer of 1917, in the midst of the Great War, ten year-old Frances Griffiths sat clapping furiously in her seat as Peter Pan flew across the stage at the Duke of York Theater in London. Just for those wondrous few minutes, she was transported away from the reality of her missing soldier father and her new life as a war orphan and into an exuberant world of innocence and hope. Frances could not have known then that in a few short months she and her cousin Elsie would bring others hope as they stood at the center of one of the 20th centuries most incredible controversies, a controversy that would have some of the greatest minds in the world, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini, wondering if they too should dare to believe in fairies.
Director Charles Sturridge (Gulliver’s Travels) has fashioned an elaborate film fantasy from this real-life tale. He tracked down the house where the girls had lived and found the son of Elsie Wright, played in the film by Florence Hoath. The son gave Sturridge access to all of Elsie’s notebooks, papers, the family photograph albums, and her autobiography. Peter O’Toole worked with Sturridge on Gulliver’s Travels, and the director felt he would be just right for the part of Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a tall, patrician, successful upper middle class Englishman. For Houdini, Sturridge selected Harvey Keitel (The Piano, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction)."

The stuff defies gravity and looks like rubber. What is it? Flubber!
In 1961, Walt Disney’s The Absent-Minded Professor was the most popular film of the year. The sparkling comedy-fantasy starring Fred MacMurray had the unmistakable Disney magic touch, perfectly blending humor, action and rollicking fun for all ages.

In his obsessive attempts to get a glance of her, he is surprised by a monstrous being. Down at the reception, the old landlord examines the contents of the hoover bag.

Refusing to give the press and the public the path explanations they want, the brothers, with their unflappable humor and complete lack of remorse become the kind of media heroes that only a 1990’s America could embrace. Their bloody escape from prison leads to a massive manhunt, with a titillated public glued anxiously to their televisions, alternately thrilled and afraid. Barely eluding the dragnet, the iconoclastic killers hole up in a typical suburban town, taking the Ryan family hostage. This perfect middle-American household becomes the arena for a showdown between the killers and the country that spawned them. Nothing escapes the brother’s double-barreled, frontal assault: The cult of celebrity. The L.A.P.D. The media. Credit cards. Consumerism. Family values. Even a few irritating neighbors. But it’s the brothers who are in for a nasty surprise. It appears the Ryan’s have a few of their own axes to grind. And the James boys have a thing or two to learn about killing.

Out in the pouring rain in a dreary, menacing world she continues her journey. A truck driver and his companion accept to take her with them. But the old woman soon discovers that they are less friendly than they seem to be. The landscape of Long Twilight is a treacherous, man-eating place where anything can happen to anyone. Where an ogre can emerge from anybody. The servants of hell are everyday monsters, simple bus and truck drivers, riders of the forest, bicyclists or farm hands. Underneath their forbearing indifference and rare kindness there is always a glowing murderous anger. In this valley of tears where nothing matters, the flame of lurking madness is the only sign of life.

Medusa was a woman with a face so horrible, that it would petrify anybody, who would happen to look at it. She was killed by Perseus, an ancient hero. Perseus, rather than looking directly at her, looked at her image as it was reflected on the surface of his shield. The film keeps close to the myth, except for one change. In the film Medusa petrifies men only. If a woman happens to see her face, then she becomes the new Medusa, while the old one collapses into a pile of sand. Perseus is haunted by childhood memories of petrified men and strange, awesome women. He is the leader of a small gang, that breaks into houses. Until the day they break into the house of Medusa.

Peter’s wife, Caroline, is found huddled upstairs, holding a knife, covered in blood. Caroline is taken to the police station to be questioned and has no recollection of the events that led up to their murders. Detective Holloway suggests that Caroline sees Dr. Ellis, a renowned hypnotherapist, in the hope that he may help her remember the events of that evening. During her session, she regresses to the past and relives the day that she and Peter got engaged as well as several points during their marriage. As she begins to regress, it becomes apparent that what her conscious mind remembers is vastly different from what her sub-conscious relives. As we get closer to the events that lead up to the murder, Caroline “remembers” that Peter had plotted to kill her and she killed him in self defense. But, what Caroline soon discovers is that Dr. Ellis is not the benevolent doctor she thought he was and the memories she recalled in her session may not be real - or are they?
Murder in Mind debuted as a stage play in England in 1995. Author Michael Cooney adapted it for the screen for producers Jeremy Paige and Vicky Slotnick. The film is directed by Andrew Morahan (Highlander III). Nigel Hawthorne (The Madness of King George) plays Dr. Ellis, an expert in hypnotherapy who believes memory regression will reveal that his patient Caroline - played by Mary-Louise Parker (Boys On the Side, Bullets Over Broadway, Naked in New York) - was not responsible for the murder of her husband.

The participants’ motives are as different as their personalities: marital problems, career setbacks, age related depression and inability to form relationships. Charismatic therapist Dr. Roman Romero and his helpers confront their clients with their «real» problems. Cut off from the outside world, the participants increasingly fall under the sway of the therapy. Their personalities start to change. After a week the unforeseen occurs: Dr. Romero is found murdered. Panic breaks out and the psychotherapy turns into psychological warfare. The tension continues to rise as in rapid succession absurd accusations are traded, identities mistaken, accidents occur and false assumptions are made. Chance events and a growing frenzy of hysteria progressively rob the protagonists of their ability to take conscious decisions, until disaster can no longer be averted.
Christian Frosch completed the first draft of the script of Totale Therapie in the summer of 1993. The project was to become his first feature-length film. Three years later he put together a dedicated young crew to realize his tragicomic psycho-thriller. Totale Therapie introduces us to a world where things are falling apart and self-appointed saviors can trigger complete disaster."

He and his family spend the summers at the lake of Thuit, a small village in Normandie. They stay at the Thuit castle. Gérald made several family-films during their holidays, most of them in the ever sunny garden of the castle. The film he wanted to make before his disappearance was set at the lake. He went searching for the best spot and the best light and never returned. Until today no-one knows in which circumstances the lawyer vanished.
Ths mysterious fait divers inspired Spanish director José Luis Guerin (Los motivos de Berta, City Life) for a reflection about film. With the restored family-films of Gérald Fleury, Guerin makes a link between present and the nostalgia of the past. He mixes the films with documentary flashes of today’s Thuit and fictive, acted reconstructions of the summers of the Fleury family. The lake, the castle and the garden didn’t change in all those years. At sunset light falls through the curtains, and reflects the shape of Gérald Fleury on the castle’s clock. Tren de Sombras is an intriguing work about past and present, illusion and reality, time and images.. Tren de Sombras won the Golden Méliès 1997."

He disembarks to find the sun-addled Mandragorans engaged in a whirlpool of smoldering passion and romance: his ostrich-farming sister is sick with heartache for the mesmerist Dr. Solti, who, in turn, is passionate about both a newly uncovered statue of Venus and Zephyr, a fisherman’s widow.

Winnipeg-based Guy Maddin has crafted one of the most confounding and delirious bodies of work in film, beginning with his first feature The Death Father. In 1995, Maddin was awarded the Telluride Film Festival, the youngest person ever to receive the honour.

He escapes the confines of reality by submerging himself in a fantasy world, the mythical land of Tao, where peace and harmony are defended by the five Warriors of Virtue. Yun represents the virtue of benevolence and the force of water. Yee, righteousness and the strength of metal. The virtue of order is represented by Lai, with the integrity of wood. Wisdom is Chi’s virtue and the power of fire his forte. Tsun’s virtue is marked by loyalty and the security of earth. These creatures are half human, half kangaroo. Their strength and energy are derived from the earth’s elements: fire, water, and air. Their own martial arts style is unique, using a combination of the body, heart, soul and intellect. Together with the warriors of virtue, Ryan will have to save Tad from the evil warlord Komodo, who wants to destroy the essence of this magic world: the lifesources.
The age-old story of good versus evil is about to get a new spin with the $36 million film Warriors of Virtue. The film is a production of the Law brothers, four doctors in Denver who were raised in Hong Kong. They hired Hong Kong filmmaker Ronny Yu, the dynamic director of 14 features, including The Bride with White Hair. The Characters, or Rooz as they’re affectionally called, were created by Tony Gardner, a 13-year veteran of special effects who worked on such films as Aliens, Cocoon and Gorillas in the Mist. Hong Kong costume designer Shirely Chan and her team had the daunting task of fabricating 5,000 costumes for the large cast."

The idea behind the workshop is to give students an opportunity to work with and learn from the experience of some distinguished (and sometimes notorious) film professionals. The students will have to make a short film under the supervision of a guest director. The theme of the short film has to be “Fantasy Brussels”. 
The previous years, we were fortunate to have had guest directors like Dick Maas and Freddie Francis to guide the workshop. This year it will be Lewis Gilbert whose experience is going to broaden the directing skills of the 40 students from the Narafi and Rits film schools. 
Lewis Gilbert is definitely an experienced movie veteran, who made no less than 36 long feature films. He started his career as a child actor and learned the tricks of the trade as Hitchcock’s directing assistant. He made a name for himself with patriotic war films like Light Up The Sky (1958) and Sink the Bismark (1960). Gilbert also directed three successful Bond movies : You only love Twice, The Spy who loved Me and Moonraker.

Tony (Top Gun en True Romance) and Ridley Scott (Alien en Blade Runner) recently made their small screen debut with the Hunger, a television series consisting of 22 short stories. The two brothers produced all the episodes and even founded their own production house just for the series : Scott Free Productions.
Each episode is a mixture of a parable and a modern city-tale, in which the shadow sides of human passions and desires are being probed. The human hunger for power, money or sex, which causes the downfall of the characters, is very recognisable and thus a lot more frightening than any paranormal or alien horror. This doesn’t mean that the series stays away from fantasy. With success, it walks the thin line between the natural and the supernatural. Each director gives a different interpretation to the themes that are being treated by the series. Some episodes use extreme violence, while others are more erotically charged…
Each episode is introduced and concluded by Terence Stamp (Priscilla Queen of the Desert). This is what he has to say about his part : “My character has lived many lifetimes and resides now in a mausoleum with many strange things around him” His presence adds a touch of the fantastic, which is a beautiful contrast with the reality of the passions and desires of the protagonists in the different episodes. 
The crew for the Hunger is a mixture of established professionals and young unknown talent. Regarding directors, besides Tony Scott, we can also mention Jake Scott (cousin of), Darrel Wasyk, Russell Mulcahy (director of Highlander) and lesser known names as Patricia Rozema, Pierre Dalpe and others. Regarding the actors, it strikes out to see that the series has firmly chosen for rising young talent; with relatively unknown names such as Lena Heady, Giancarlo Esposito, Leonardo Cimino and many others. Besides this talented young bunch, the series also uses the services of some veterans of the silver screen like Karen Black (Easy Rider), Michael Gross (Family Ties), Amanda Ryan (Jude), …

As his works attract the public, a lot of exhibitions take place all around Japan, and Amano’s fantastic pictures gradually enter other media. For exemple Amano takes part to video game creation, as well as scenography and costume design for plays. Among his creations we can also mention stained glass windows destined to the Fairy Museum in Fukushima in the north of Tokyo. Furthermore his paintings, the theme of which comes from the Arabian Nights, will soon be brought back in a CG animation in California...

His “monsters” are not frightening, they intrigue. They are related to the king cobolts and other “Heinzelmännchen” of the extensive Eifel-Ardens-forest. When they walk at their feet, too small to support their body, they seem obsessed by the longing to approach the human beings to express their affection. Together, we enter the world of the cartoon and sci-fi films.
Dressed in long garments, gowns or djellabahs, a crowd of priests and grandmasters stride to a strangely decorated temple. The creatures have small, clawlike hands, more eager to grab money than to caress. They move in that formal, starchy and arrogant way of superiors (or those who think they are). The colors of their cloths are white, red and black : symbolic colors. Those “invisible rulers” (cf. Serge Hutin), have weird bird-heads confirming what their hands already told us.
Jacques Dubois, creator of this insane universe, uniting the world of the animals with that of humans, is a calm man, moving without sorrow in this tumulteous world. His strange beings reveal a notion of the «holy». At the end of this comical century, when we are to discover other inhabited worlds, it is not impossible that an artist anticipates unexplicable things. The pantheon of the artist rejoins the one dominating the world thirty centuries ago, when the first principle was the harmony between the world above and the one we live in.

Sculptors Vilma and Jean-Marc Laroche are gifted alchemists.  In Brazil they get the resin to sculpt objects from long forgotten legends. Ornamented with metal, bones, and threatening hooks, they take you by surprise.  The dark beauty of their sculptures seduces you. Eye or tooth, a freightening look or a cruel laugh.
Vilma and Laroche are inspired by artists as Druillet and Giger. Mixed with Vilma’s Afro-Brazilian culture and a passion for primitive art, they give birth to unique objects. An insectlike clock, a vampirelike lamp, flying knives and strange encaged mummies. Vilma and Laroche guide us through an imaginary world and confront us with our fear and phobias. They give the dark and macabre a new dimension. To become masters in the transmutation of metals they made some sculptures in bronze and silver. Their imagination has no limits in time or space.
