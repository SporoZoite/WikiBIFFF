One year after the timely death of General Franco, to the great relief of the Spanish people, who can finally breathe again. In this elated atmosphere the Olmedo family has purchased a dirt cheap apartment at 32 Malasaña Street. It’s a fresh start for Manolo and co, a clean slate. Of course, these aren’t luxurious times and the mortgage is quite spicy, but as long as the family takes care of itself and grandpa doesn’t soil the shiny parquet floor, they should be able to pull it off. Except, they didn’t quite look into the history of their new home and they will rather quickly find out they’ve got themselves a haunted house. Little Rafi will be the first to discover this inconvenient fact, swallowed whole by the walls of the apartment! First discovered at the BIFFF (and then the rest of the world) in 2018 with KILLING GOD, Albert Pinto sure didn’t waste any time! He returns with 32 MALASANA STREET with one simple goal: to make your skin crawl! Imagine INSIDIOUS taking place at the apartment of REC. If that already gives you the creeps, stay clear of this rollercoaster of jump scares that builds up to a horrifying conclusion. Honestly, just cancel your moving plans altogether..."

The notorious Mafia hitman Peppino Lo Cicero is enjoying his retirement and has left the killing to his handsome son Nino. For his birthday, he’s bought him a beautiful Colt Cobra. Unfortunately, there will be nothing to celebrate today. Nino falls into a trap and gets a bunch of lead in his chest. Toto the Butcher, an old friend and colleague of Peppino, brings him the sad news. Peppino might be old, he hasn’t lost his killing touch. He sets out on a quest for vengeance that will spare nothing and no one. The streets of Naples will turn into rivers of blood. Igort, aka Igor Tuveri, is an internationally renowned Italian illustrator, comic-strip writer, writer and musician with a career spanning four decades. His very first feature, 5 IS THE PERFECT NUMBER, is an adaptation of his eponymous comic. This hyper-stylized film-noir, which brings to mind SIN CITY, can count on the phenomenal acting talent of Toni Servillo (LA GRANDE BELLEZA) as angel of vengeance Peppino Lo Cicero."

It has always been his dream to adapt Lovecraft to the big screen – not very surprising, coming from a guy who sleeps with a Cthulu toy next to him every night, we’re not making this up! – and he succeeds with flying otherwordly colors! That he was able to get Nicolas Cage for the leading role is a small miracle in itself! Cage is the pater familias in the Spielbergian sense. He keeps the peace in his harmoniously average American family, who also happen to take care of a couple of alpacas. Alpacas? Huh, never seen those in a Spielberg flick! But of course their calm existence is going to be shaken by some very strange events… Cage gives a great, colorful performance, but the alpacas almost – just almost – steal his thunder in a THE THING-like fashion. Stanley has said that if COLOR OUT OF SPACE is a box-office success, he’s going to film two more Lovecraft stories, each of ‘m more cosmically apocalyptic as the last. So, you know what to see!"

But the older we get, the less naïve we become and young Abigail starts to figure out things. Not only does she seemingly possesses similar powers as you know who, that boy with the lightning-bolted forehead, but there’s magic in every crook and cranny in town! One discovery leads to another. Abigail realizes that the whole epidemic is a smokescreen, a pitiful excuse that the authorities use to keep the town and its potentially rebellious wizards under their thumb. But if they said that her dad died from the virus, does that mean… Every shot is a beauty to behold in this steampunk fairytale that inevitably brings to mind HARRY POTTER and FANTASTIC BEASTS. It’s a thrilling quest with at the end of the road a beautiful message for the young ones: be yourself, you’re unique and no one’s taking that away from you. For the older ones it’s too late anyway. You can’t be changed, so just sit back, relax and enjoy this phenomenal spectacle!"

But there’s no place like home, so Pablo Cabezas said Adios to the United States and Hola España to his native city of Sevilla, to shoot his new film. Juan, a model prisoner, gets permission to attend his daughter’s communion. But a car accident brings the party and his daughter’s life to a screeching halt… The kind of tough luck that Fate sometimes deals us? It seems so. Until Juan discovers that it’s all linked to the drug trade that rots the city’s core and corrupts its cops. Juan’s no innocent. He didn’t get locked up for some unpaid parking tickets, but for being part himself of one of the most powerful crime families in town. So, it’s going to be a different kind of family reunion than he’d imagined... Paco Cabezas delivers a pitch-black masterpiece, the type only Spaniards seem to know the secret of."

But don’t expect a Ugandan TAKEN, this is way, way more insane… There’s the Waka Starz, street kids and certified martial arts masters, an evil midget crime boss, Bruce U (“Uganda’s Best Kung-fu Cop!”), and many other colorful characters in the midst of explosions and shoot-outs that make Michael Bay seem like a pacifist monk. You can also count on the Wakiliwood trademark of VJ Emmie, commenting all the action on the screen, which is never less than hilarious (“He moves like a tiger, stings like a bitch!”). Loads of fun and with a heartfelt message about the fate of children in the slums."

But a first disappointment quickly follows.

Luckily he has his girlfriend to take his mind off the matter. But one day, chatting with her on the rooftop, tragedy occurs. He’s knocked out and when he regains consciousness, the lifeless body of his girl lies beside him and he catches a glimpse of the murderer jumping off the building. Suicide after a horrible deed?

That’s right, the military police’s so-called “Death Squad” that has been active in the favelas of Rio de Janeira for years now, taking many lives in its urban warfare. Considering he produced mega-hit ELITE SQUAD, it’s not entirely surprising director Marcos Prado opted for a protagonist who’s part of this deadly unit.

The film has been screened no more than six times in the entire world and Netflix didn’t hesitate a second to get it for their catalogue.

A dystopian allegory on class struggle, a recipe that strongly smells like Vincenzo Natali and Luis Buñuel, half-way between cannibalism and pudding.

Old school, like everything about Mr. Dark: his speech, manner, clothes, mansion, the music that plays in the background – yes, even the grainy film images, everything suggests the glory days of 70’s and 80’s. But Sam, his new apprentice who wasn’t even born when his favorite horror flicks were released, is going to burst his bubble. Monty tries to spook her with a couple of tales from the crypt: stories with Lovecraftian tentacles, or highly unusual – and graphic! – pregnancies, or love beyond the tomb… But all he gets are jaded reactions: “It’s not bad”, “I was expecting something a bit more substantial, maybe an ironic come-uppance or a big twist”, “a bit predictable”… Yup, she’s pretty much like the BIFFF audience! Spindell’s brilliant 2015 short THE BABYSITTER MURDERS was the starting point for this one-of-a-kind anthology that has those vintage thrills of say, EC Comics and CREEPSHOW but with a modern-day ironic wink. It’s gorgeous to look at and Clancy Brown was born to play the gravely funny mortician Dark."

But it turns out the killer is back on the loose and the killing spree that ensues has an uncanny resemblance to Todd’s drawings… Based on the eponymous comic by Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti, Jay Baruchel (known as the funny guy in movies such as KNOCKED UP) pours oil on the fire of the controversial debate on how violence is portrayed in the media. Does violent art inspire real-world violence? We can already hear Marilyn Manson groan, but one thing’s for sure: these random acts of violence are hard to stomach! Enhanced by a chilling sound design, you’re drawn into the extremely gruesome kills with every stab and drop of blood.

Pixar and Disney excel at pulling at heartstrings and here they succeed in flying colors again. But what makes ONWARD so special is its very personal touch. Dan Scanlon (director of MONSTERS UNIVERSITY) lost his own dad at the age of 1 and that experience was the starting point for the script. Spending one full day with a beloved person you’ve lost, who couldn't relate to that? Plus, it’s as if Pixar made this movie with us in mind: Barley’s a heavy role-play gamer, the soundtrack’s very LORD OF THE RINGS-yand at one point they have to follow statues of ravens.

Her magical powers could perhaps bring her son back to life? Kerena warns her not to disturb the Mother, but Julia doesn’t listen. The child returns - admittedly with a couple of quirks - but he’s not alone… Laura Casabé has already been at the BIFFF - in 2016, for her feature debut BENAVIDEZ’S CASE - and returns with an entirely different beast: an atmospheric, alienating slow burner that gave us the heebie-jeebies. In terms of vibe - and that terrorizing shade of black! - we were reminded of UNDER THE SKIN, but instead of an alien in Glasgow you get angry native people revolting against their ‘civilized’ oppressor. The jungle itself, magnificent, dense and claustrophobic, seems to resist: the Western colonialists don’t stand a chance in this environment. In these dark times for nature and native people in Latin America (Bolivia, Brazil, …), it’s fantastic to see them take revenge, at least on the big screen."

But when Belén and a handful of other local daughters are kidnapped and end up in a prostitution network with ties to several politicians and policemen, Selena goes berserk. Berserk on the patriarchal society that has been pushing her and her family around for too long and that will now regret it. Buh-bye hippie witch, hello merciless angel of vengeance. Erica Rivas (WILD TALES, TETRO) is out of this world in the role of spited spell-caster: she’s intense, sensual, powerful and yet fragile, a Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, pushed over the edge to the point of no return.

We’re in 1985, Luis gets a call from his parents with bad news: his twin sister suddenly died. He immediately returns home, but strangely his parents don’t say a word about the mysterious circumstances of her death… A nice father-to-son talk with his authoritarian dick of a dad is unlikely to happen and the ever more frequent encounters with demonic creatures don’t exactly help either. There’s more to it than meets the eye… THE ENTITY is the Philippines’ answer to Blumhouse productions, with a gothic mansion that fits in nicely with the Overlook Hotel of THE SHINING and the Seven Doors Hotel of THE BEYOND. It’s in the same league as INSIDIOUS, with the catholic guilt dialed up to 100. “Thou shalt honor thy father and mother”, as is written in, uhm… the Necronomicon? Another quote?

When Helga, a Madrilenian editor, is addressed by a fellow passenger, a good-looking psychiatrist called Angel, she seems instantly charmed. And yet the simple question “Do you mind hearing about my life?” is going to open up infernal gates, to the weirdest, most off-beat circles of Hell that even Dante didn’t want to write about. It’s impossible to say more without spoiling the trip… Well, OK, a couple of words: “Orphanage”, “Garbage”, “Doggy-style”, “One-armed army man”. It’s pretty indescribable and a true kamikaze undertaking by Moreno, who adapted Antonio Orejudo’s delirious book. A book most experienced directors wouldn’t dare poke with a stick, while Moreno dives head-first into the madness and actually pulls it off!

Rad Chad sets up a Horror 101 with several short films, each taking on a different horror subgenre with a sense of humor, gore galore and especially a lot of love for horror tropes. Misogynist werewolves, a ‘final girl’ who’s less virgin than we’d imagined, a bad guy that just wouldn’t die, happy campers and their slimy fun, a psychedelic and feminist take on Mario Bava’s BLOOD AND BLACK LACE by two female directors… As you can read, there’s no shortage of bloody, witty and wacky ideas, always deliciously Meta, never very politically correct.

Fascinated by the sheer cynicism of such a character, Costa-Gavras decided to make it the subject of his next film: STATE OF SIEGE. Yves Montand played Philip Michael Santore (a fictional alias of Mitrione) who is abducted by the Tupamaros, a revolutionary group from Uruguay. The film defies all classical narrative techniques (Santore dies within the first few minutes) and is impossible to be politically pigeon-holed due to its universal nature. STATE OF SIEGE, which was nominated for the Golden Globes and the Bafta, was at the time the ultimate warning against America’s interference in South-America. Ironically its bombshell release coincided with the coming to power of Pinochet in Chili. Fifty years later, it’s fascinating - not to say absolutely terrifying - to see how relevant this film still is today."

He leaves the bag in the locker of a sauna, where it is found by janitor Joong-man. With a sick mom and the towering rent to pay, a nice little extra sure wouldn’t hurt… But he’ll have to compete with a motley crew of the already-mentioned gangsters, a laconic cop with a strong appetite, a prostitute, her wife beater of a husband, her tough boss and her Chinese boyfriend… One dialogue sums it up perfectly: “The sand tiger shark bears 50 or so eggs when pregnant. The babies eat each other in the mother’s belly. Only one will be born, and it becomes a fierce predator”. Survival of the Strongest y’all, they’re all beast clawing at the same bag… Who will draw the longest straw?

You’ve got gnomes on roller-skates, centaur officers patrolling the streets, cute little dragons as pets, trolls drinking Trolls (we’ve seen the deleted scenes!) and unicorns eating out of dumpsters. Two elf brothers, Ian and Barley, grew up without their father, who died at a young age. But they find out dad left them a magic staff that can bring him back to life for 24 hours. Unfortunately… they mess up the spell and end up with half a dad, just his legs! And so begins their extraordinary quest and a race against the clock to complete the spell. Pixar and Disney excel at pulling at heartstrings and here they succeed in flying colors again. But what makes ONWARD so special is its very personal touch. Dan Scanlon (director of MONSTERS UNIVERSITY) lost his own dad at the age of 1 and that experience was the starting point for the script. Spending one full day with a beloved person you’ve lost, who couldn't relate to that? Plus, it’s as if Pixar made this movie with us in mind: Barley’s a heavy role-play gamer, the soundtrack’s very LORD OF THE RINGS-yand at one point they have to follow statues of ravens. That’s right: always follow the Raven!"

She's going to sail with the equally hostile Captain Gerard, who doesn’t give a rat’s ass about maritime biology, but only cares about big bright bucks. That's why he sets course to unknown - and forbidden - waters. Who knows what kind of fish he might be able to catch in his nets? Well, it sure ain’t Moby Dick, but a completely different kind of beast that’ll rise from the dark abysses of the ocean to say hello and grab hold of their boat… As you can imagine, this feels like THE ABYSS or ALIEN at sea, with an added and welcome drop of Cronenbergian body horror to feast your eyeballs on!

Those cold, clinical fingers up his bum stir up a dark desire deep within his bowels. He tries to get his wife into his new little kink, but when she doesn’t cooperate he’s forced to take things into his own hands.

Will he be able to stop this insatiable asshole? He’s no slouch but he doesn’t quite realize yet how deep the rabbit hole goes… Actor-director Tyler Cornack’s gutsy first feature-length film transcends the simple butt jokes (even though there’s plenty of that too), flirts with the urban thriller in the vein of Fincher or Mann, and wanders into ever stranger territory, to places where no man has gone before.

That means no more cozy, snuggly evenings with your boyfriends on the couch... The latter’s more jealous than the average Ikea closet and starts a-killing one by one the dudes that try getting between him and Franscesca. Shiny buttons for eyes, its mouth a crooked seam and most importantly, a foot rest as its improbable but ultimate slaughter weapon! So kick back, relax - but do pay a bit of attention to our BIFFF seats (we haven’t been feeding them since last year’s edition) – and enjoy this New Zealand gem by Bernie Rao.

Because, yes folks, reality once again beats fiction hands down. As it seems to be easier to create your own terrorists instead of catching real ones, the FBI has led numerous sting operations over the years, trying to deliberately provoke, radicalize and imprison suspected or potential threats to the homeland.

He already told us all about it at the BIFFF 2012, but for those of you who didn’t have a chance to drink a Troll with William Friedkin, our Knight of the Order of the Raven is giving an extremely detailed account of the filmmaking process here. You’d be forgiven to think that this is barely more than a feature-length DVD bonus, with Mr. Friedkin in an armchair talking, while images of his masterpiece flash by. But then you don’t know Philippe. He urges the director to get personal. Sure, we all know this film is perhaps the greatest horror classic of all time. That doesn’t make heads turn (360 degrees) anymore. What is of interest however is how much of himself he had put into the film he had in mind when it came to cast, score, sound design, locations, idiosyncratic decisions and brilliant, almost divine inspiration on set.

Torn between two worlds; will their forbidden love survive? Romeo and Juliet anyone? Yeah, except with gigantic snake battles, evil overlords, a kinky fox demon lady and her creepy dwarf servants, reincarnation and… a talking dog called Dudou. If the yin of WHITE SNAKE is Studio Ghibli, than its yang is Disney: intelligent, moving, truly imaginative but with enough goofy, fun characters to keep the kids laughing and frolicking throughout. Add to that a pinch of Dragon Ball Z – because epic demon monsters call for epic battles –, cross it with a classic Chinese folktale and you’ve got quite a spicy dish!

I call it the city of bullshitters. This place sucks the life right out of ya. Some people pick themselves up after getting the shit knocked out of ‘m. Others break down like an old station wagon”. Right from the get-go, it’s pretty clear we’re in a different LA than in ONCE UPON A TIME… IN HOLLYWOOD. It’s a tough place where only the strong survive and well, Moose (John Travolta)… isn’t a tough guy. He’s an obsessive film buff and a rabid movie memorabilia collector, but his mental issues and lack of social skills make him an easy target for ridicule or worse. His luck seems to improve when he gets a chance to meet his idol, action star Hunter Dunbar (Devon Sawa), but he turns out to be… an insufferable prick who doesn’t want to give him his autograph that Moose, as his #1 fan, feels he’s entitled to! He will get that autograph though, even if it means stalking Dunbar to his house and eh, things get a little out of hand… Fred Durst, yes, of Limp Bizkit fame and yes, they’re on the soundtrack, based the film on his own personal experiences (which we hope were less extreme), and he offers John Travolta the opportunity to go all-fucking-out with a performance which reaches levels of Nicolas Cage zaniness. Yessir! Believe us: the cult of THE FANATIC is rising!"

Our blonde is called Cassie and you need to know two things about her. She’s anything but drunk and she really really really hates nice guys. PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN had its world premiere at the Sundance Festival and hit like a bombshell with the critics and the audience. This is one juicy piece of revenge porn for the #MeToo age, thought-provoking, controversial and with a shocking and unexpected climax. Obviously we can’t tell much about the story, but know that this feature debut by actress and writer Emerald Farrell (produced by Margot Robbie!) will lead to many heated discussions and will keep you flabbergasted in your seats."

I want to speed up, not slow down”. As long as you keep on giving us stuff as FIRST LOVE we’re in for the ride!

Miike returns to his first love indeed: the yakuza tough guys of GOZU (BIFFF 2004) or DEAD OR ALIVE, but the criminal underworld has changed quite a bit: the yakuza lose more and more ground to the Chinese triads, young ambitious members don’t care about tradition to get what they want… Is Miike gettin’ a touch sentimental? “The most important thing is humanity” says one Chinese gangster to Leo… right before jumping into an over-the-top climax full of gushing blood, samurai swords and life-saving cocaine!"

When Jamie invites his friends to his family cabin for Christmas, Simon strikes! He proves to be a worthy successor of Chuckie, with one difference: after years of watching horror movies on TV next to Jamie, he’s become quite the film connoisseur.

It is the hour when the sleepless are haunted by their worst anguish, when ghosts and demons are most powerful”. Huh, never thought we’d quote Ingmar Bergman at the BIFFF! Indeed our favorite she-wolf, Naomi Watts (TWIN PEAKS, MULHOLLAND DRIVE), plunges head-first into her worst paranoid nightmares – and we’re there all the way! – when she holes herself up in a rundown apartment in the Bronx. Her character June was an important counter-culture writer in the 60’s, but public pressure got the better of her and a decade later she ends up with a writer’s block in a flat… during the NY blackout riots of 1977! She tries to shut out the scary, violent, sexist outside world by never leaving her apartment. But maybe the biggest danger lingers inside, inside the flat or inside her mind… Catherine Deneuve went through a similar lonely hell in REPULSION, but director Alistair Banks Griffin adds an undercurrent of racial tension and feminist outrage. And then there’s still the issue of the doorbell that keeps on ringing… Who’s there?"

Patrick and Markus, two inspectors with radically opposing methods, arrive in the German middle of nowhere three years after the fall of the Wall to investigate the mysterious disappearance of two twin sisters. After the bodies of the girls resurface, the former indifference of the locals transforms into a tenacious hostility towards the two cops… Sound familiar? That’s normal, as it’s a remake of LA ISLA MINIMA (Thriller award BIFFF 2015)! While staying loyal to the original Alvart adds his own twist to the story by transposing the action from Spain to the political context of a recently unified Germany. His fervor for the topic bubbles up to the surface of heart-stopping visual imagery. FREE COUNTRY isn’t just a phenomenal thriller, but a sign of unforeseen renewal: from now on, Germany + police will no longer equal inspector Derrick. And we can only feel relieved about that!"

Bandi is exhaling his last breaths in a strangely empty building. Lost in the middle of nowhere. With servants who observe them as if they’re straight out of the Indonesian version of GET OUT… A very liberal re-interpretation of the eponymous 1981 classic, this isn't for everbody's eyes.

It all started in 2014, when a nightmarish YouTube video went viral. We see a little girl peacefully sleeping in her room when, suddenly, a clown crawls from under her bed... His phone number could be seen all over the city and Wrinkles got flooded with desperate calls of parents urging him to eat up their naughty toddlers.

Olya and Artyom lost their mommy in a car crash and are sent to a local boarding school, a creepy gothic mansion that in Soviet times must’ve been Lord Dracula’s favorite hide-out. Hiding out, that’s exactly what the siblings and a bunch of friends do in the school’s coziest space, the cellar. Between cob webs and torture gear, they discover an awfully mysterious-looking mirror… and they immediately start evoking the title character, a sort of Bloody Mary who had one too many shots of vodka. They each make a wish that to their surprise is always granted but unfortunately for them, as a true Russian spirit, the Queen’s sense of humor is rather dark… Afterwards we all headed to the basement of the Center for Fine Arts to check if by any chance some evil-reeking mirror was lying about, but all we found were some old whips and chains. A relief! But we don’t recommend wondering about during the BIFFF… Judging by these last few years, Russia’s genre film production is in top shape!"

That’s the whole thing about fantasy: we leave behind the shores of reality. So, why return to them? It’s simple: fantasy feeds on reality, transforms it and stretches it in all possible directions. But its starting point will always be reality. And, during our numerous prospection trips, we have been dumbfounded by the sheer quality of these documentaries. Not only because they’re insightful, and because a good dose of culture and contextualization can’t hurt in these troubled times. But also because a solid love for movies is very much like constructing a house. If you don’t pay attention to the foundations, they can come crumbling down at any given moment!

2020,event,"Comics, 13th Comics Land",,13th Comics Land,"Alain, Poncelet",,,,"As a freelance illustrator Alain Poncelet has been publishing collections of illustrations and graphic novels full of legendary and magical creatures for over ten years. He just loves putting the dark side of our human nature out in the open, painting its blackness, plunging into the nightmares, telling stories no-one is comfortable listening to, dipping his pen into heavy metal and summoning our worst fears. It all started in 2005, with the publication of his first comic book at Nocturne, “Cinema Fantastic”, followed by two graphic novels “Catharsis” and “Rupture(s)”. 2010 marks the beginning of the fruitful collaboration with industrial metal band Skeptical Minds, led by Michel Stiakakis, an old friend. It’s a match made in hell: Alain quickly finds himself in charge of the designs for T-shirts, the album covers and the stage props. The collaboration intensifies with the publication of “Broken Dolls”, a comic strip putting a song of the band into images. Images that were later used during concerts of Skeptical Minds. Alain and the band are then in complete harmony, to the point of putting out a joined “object”, a comic/CD. “Omega Thanatos” sees the light of day in October 2015 and forms a trilogy with two more albums. In In 2012 Alain is aked to participate in a collective project by Italian publishing house Passenger Press. “Noire odyssée” retraces Homer’s Odyssey in an erotic version. Two other books will also be published by Passenger Press: “Apocalypse Tarot” and “Dead Art Book”, the latter which was presented at the Lucca Comics & Games in 2013. From 2012 until 2015 he also took part in the “Sketchbook Project” initiated by the Brooklyn Art Library in New York. This one of a kind library publishes several sketchbooks of artists from around the globe. The library even organized a world tour to present the sketchbooks. As a fanatic of all things fantastic, Alain is a loyal fan of the BIFFF. That’s why he was the logical choice to be the artist of our 2020 festival poster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,event,"Focus, Russian Focus",,Russian Focus,,,,,"Sergei Eisenstein, Dziga Vertov, Lev Kulechov, Vsevolod Pudovkin… We’re talking about a time that those of us under 100 have never known: the Golden Age of Russian cinema! After that, a little something called the Cold War sabotaged the defenders of the 7th art and their work struggled to get across the iron curtain. It wasn’t until the Perestroika that Russian cinema got back on its feet, which wasn’t a walk in the park. Nevertheless, the government put their back into it, financing several theaters from Moscow until the farthest corners of Siberia (and beyond!), producing quality content, assuring a smooth system - going from pre-production all the way to guaranteed distribution in theaters - and lowering prices for film tickets. The result? In less than 10 years the amount of Russian cinemas has tripled, the country has the fourth biggest box office in Europe and pretty much all national films are smash hits. Something we in Belgium can only dream of. Anyhow, here at BIFFF we’ve been keeping an eye on our Russian friends and we’ve decided 2020 is to be the year of a Russian focus. After all, exactly one hundred years ago one of their greatest sci-fi writers was born: Isaar Asimov. Dobro pozhalovat’!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,event,Art Exhibition,,Pieter Pauwel Gallery,"Nathan, Vranckx",,,,"Nathan has been drawing since forever. Throughout the years, after much research and work, he has created a universe filled with all kinds of species, with a very personal aesthetic.  Ever since his early childhood he’s had a strong passion for genre cinema, especially horror movies. Film is without a doubt his biggest influence, with literature and the arts in general. Later on he got fascinated by the human condition, in particular its darker, miserable side. 
His paintings are timeless, always with a certain humoristic touch. He works with form, light and texture.
Deformation is the name of his game, his images always mysterious and organic. ‘If life is beautiful, it is not meant to be taken seriously’ he says!  Monstrosity is at the service of art in order to render all that repulses and disgusts common mortals desirable…  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020,event,Art Exhibition,,Pieter Pauwel Gallery,"Lan,",,,,"Lan’s universe is a cross between fantasy, cyberpunk and science fiction, with a poetic, melancholic and a small touch of gloom. His style is strongly emotional and varies depending on what each artwork aims for. Bringing across a message? An impression? Or simply the look of a character, the charm of a creature … The most important thing above all is that everything is organic and coherent. So it’s not exactly art in a strict sense, it’s an open window to Lan’s dreams.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,event,Art Exhibition,,Pieter Pauwel Gallery,"Palix,",,,,"Palix is known for his aquarelle sketches of the major trials that have shaken Belgium since 2003 (Cools, Dutroux, Fourniret or more recently Salah Abdeslam, Nemmouche, the euthanasia case…). These courtroom sketches have been published in Belgian and international media and were showcased in the Grand Palace in Paris. He’s also – and perhaps above all – an artist blessed with an unlimited imagination. He creates oil paintings that take you to a poetic, fantastical universe, rich in details that titillate our inner child’s spirit. His work is an invitation to freeze time and dream with open eyes…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,event,Art Exhibition,,Pieter Pauwel Gallery,"RVH,",,,,"My name is Raphaël Vanhomwegen. I live in Brussels. I started digital painting in 2010 but really accelerated my learning curve in January 2019. Even though I studied psychology and human resources at the University of Ghent, I decided to make a career switch. I’ve always been interested in drawing. When I was a little kid, I could spend hours drawing little cartoon figures from Lucky Luke and other funny comic books. What I love the most about digital painting is the freedom it gives me to create anything I want in a very short time. Speed is the skill I value the most. It has become part of my identity and my philosophy. Focusing on speed also created a mindset in which decisions were a result of very deeply integrated knowledge and motoric reflexes. It exposes my biggest weaknesses, making it easier to identify them and therefore drawing better each time. I love monsters! Enjoy the creepiness of my creations! ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020,event,Art Exhibition,,Pieter Pauwel Gallery,"D., Gueulette",,,,"He’s always been passionate about the optimization of the human body and he would naturally apply that to his art. He presents humanoids that marry his mechanical know-how to the art of sculpture. His favorite material, you ask? Stainless steel, which he bends and tweaks into forms that are far removed of what it’s habitually used for. Tubes, rounds, placards and wires of stainless steel are transformed into bones, muscles and ligaments. His sculptures are made out of a combination of mechanical elements that, bent and wrapped in different types of imperfect skin, obtain a remarkably organic aspect. His biggest source of inspiration is contemporary dance and sports. Movement is primordial. Anatomy, plastination, cybernetics and transhumanism define David Gueulette’s steel statues. At times organic, at times mechanic, often both and always imbalanced. A snapshot before the fall… ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
