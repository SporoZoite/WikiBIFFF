1992,edition,Poster,,,"Hergé,",,,,"Considered by all as the «pope
of the clear line», much of
Hergé’s stories flirt outrageously with
the Fantastic and with
Sciencefiction, fields that, at first
sight, are not so «clear». The
adventures of «Tintin» are genuine
Hitchcock thrillers, liberally
sprinkled with the fantastic, and
the macabre,
«Jo et Zette» are unceasingly
exposed to sadistic and mad
scientists, while «Quick et Flupke» rub
shoulders almost daily with phantoms as well as with
the monster of Loch Ness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1992,event,"Hommage, Hommage to James Coburn",,Hommage to James Coburn,,,,,"In 1973 Raoul Ruiz exchanges Chile for Paris, where his style suddenly turns towards fantasy. His films follow labyrinthine plot lines and inventively display a powerful feeling of displacement. For the viewer this results in feelings of disorientation, enhanced by Ruiz’s generous images and favoured by intelligent editing. Cinema Nova presents a small selection from the vast body of work that Ruiz has produced over the years : the enigmatic thriller The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting (1978), The Territory (1981, co-produced by Roger Corman ), Treasure Island (1985) and Fado majeur et mineur (1993).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
